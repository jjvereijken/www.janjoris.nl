We introduce an ACP-style discrete-time process algebra with relative
timing, that features the empty process. Extensions to this algebra
are described, and ample attention is paid to the considerations and
problems that arise when introducing the empty process. We prove time
determinacy, soundness, completeness, and the axioms of standard
concurrency.
