You have to run the Olives through CanHex first.

Your fridge "bug" report was not specific enough. How do you expect to get
answers without telling me what version refrigerator you are using? It sounds

Kenmore's new Fridge Input/Output System (FIOS). Yes, I know we did not

We would like to conclude by presenting our view on the importance of
efficiency. It is fashionable in some circles especially some academic ones,
to deprecate the importance of efficiency. The argument goes: "It is
programming time, not execution time, that matters. What difference does it
make if the program runs one minute or two?" This argument is often used, for
example, to encourage the use of some of the newer, often less efficient,
programming languages.

It is difficult to argue with this. In fact we don't for our own
programs. Our time is MUCH more important than the machine's. However,
the other fellow's program (yours) is an entirely different matter!
Every second that his programs executes, ours can't. If his program is
inefficient, we are the ones who suffer, not him. The problem of
efficiency is NOT one of how long it takes to run A program, but rather
one of obtaining the maximum benefit from a finite resource.

    I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by my
wife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or
else...  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  I
withdrew the cork from the first bottle and pured the contents down the
sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew
the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the
exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from
the thrid bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I
pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the
bottle down the glass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the
cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down
the glass.  I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork
down the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the
drink and drank the pour.  When I had everything emptied, I steadied
the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks
with the other, which were twent-nine, and as the houses came by I
counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle,

	 A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling
			  by Mark Twain

	For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped
to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer
be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which "c" would be retained
would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2
might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the
same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with
"i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.
	Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear
with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12
or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.
Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi
ridandant letez "c", "y" and "x" -- bai now jast a memori in the maindz

Woz was doing various projects.  One used the total amount of memory of
an Apple II to calculate the mathematical constant E to a hundred thousand
decimal digits of accuracy.  That was a very hard thing to do, because the
Apple II didn't have much memory.  He had to use every single piece of memory,
including the memory on the display screen, to hold this big number.  And he
didn't have any intermediate results because all the memory was holding just
one number.  This program took fourteen days to run.  He just sat around for
fourteen days, waiting for the moment when it would be finished.  Often, six
days into the experiment his Apple II would flake out and crash.  He'd start
over from the beginning.  He'd do all kinds of goofy projects like that.

result in the normal clockspeed which is 1.6 times slower than with the
wire removed and will not cause corresponding increases in system throughput.

TOP TEN FAVORITE REASONS WHY I DON'T PROVE MY PROGRAMS CORRECT:

(10) It is much easier to prove a program incorrect.
(9)  Current verification methods leave a lot to be desired -- such as
     currency, verification, and method.
(8)  The dog ate my proof.
(7)  If I knew what it was going to do, it wouldn't be Research & Development,
     would it?
(6)  I paid a lot for this debugger, I'm darned well going to USE it!
(5)  Isn't that lint is for?
(4)  You go first -- prove the spec is correct.
(3)  The margin of this listing is too narrow to contain the truly marvelous
     proof-of-correctness that I just found.
(2)  I'll prove it correct just after I fix this one little bug...

And the Number One all-time reason not to prove a program correct:

(1)  *I* wrote it -- that's proof enough, isn't it?

Answer:
	That's not true. It is true Apple has an X-MP to design the
	next generation Apple, it is not true that Seymour has a
	Macintosh - Seymour has SIX Mac's. It's absolutely true that
	Seymour is very very positive on the Macintosh and he has had
	an opportunity to look at the architecture of the machine, he
	claims it is a contribution to computing. He has never seen
	anything like this in a small machine and he is the greatest

Verifiers that assume idealized arithmetic produce idealized results,
tending toward false proofs.
%
The most important step in code verification really is showing that the
program doesn't violate the language model.  This means that variables
must be initialized before use, subscripts must stay in range, numeric
computations must stay in bounds, and so forth.

If Multics cycles had been available to Dennis Ritchie when he asked
for them, he never would have written Unix.
%
When I was a computer science student in University of Tokyo, Japan, I
heard from one of assistant professors:
"In 20th century, American people were surprised three times.
 Hiroshima, Sputnik, Lisa.  Hiroshima was the first atomic bomb.
 Sputonik, the first sattellite into space.  Lisa, the first
 workstation under $10,000.  It can write, draw, calculate,
 communicate, and schedule.  That's all what we need in business."
It was 1983 maybe before Macintosh appeared (in Japan?).

Unix was not just "Multics on a low budget", it was also "90% of the
benefits at 10% of the cost".

Unix evolution is now largely controlled by the marketdroids, who
evaluate systems by the length of the checklist of features.  All sorts
of silly and bizarre features are now crawling out of the woodwork and
burrowing into Unix as a result.  This does not necesarily mean said
features are good or desirable or even useful.

Het heelal (dat anderen de Bibliotheek noemen) bestaat uit een onbepaald, en
misschien oneindig aantal zeshoekige cellen, met grote door heel lage
balustrades omheinde ventilatie-putten in het midden.  Vanaf elke zeshoek kan
men de lager- en hogerliggende verdiepingen zien: eindeloos.  De indeling van
de cellen varieert niet.  Twintig planken, vijf brede planken per zijkant,
bedekken alle zijkanten op twee na; de hoogte is die van verdiepingen en is
nauwelijks iets meer dan die van een normale bibliothecaris.  Een van de vrije
zijvlakken komt uit op een nauwe hal, die op een andere cel uitloopt, precies
gelijk als de eerste en als alle andere.  Links en rechts van de hal zijn twee
heel kleine kamertjes.  In het ene kun je net staande slapen, in het andere de
fecale behoeften bevredigen.  Daar doorheen loopt de spiraaltrap, die naar de
diepte verdwijnt en opwaarts reikt naar de verten.  In de hal is een spiegel,
die getrouw de werkelijkheid verdubbelt.  De mensen leiden gewoonlijk uit die
spiegel af dat de Bibliotheek niet oneindig is (als zij dat werkelijk was,
waartoe dan die bedrieglijke verdubbeling?); ik geef er de voorkeur aan te

Full user customization, especially of permanent- or default-changing type,
is definitely not the answer.  User A discovers the customization feature
and replaces the defaults with what she finds "nice" and "pleasing" colors.
User B is then called upon to use the same computer/the same copy of the
program but never gets around to read the manuals, and even if she did,
wouldn't know how to proceed anyway.  Thus she is forced to use someone
else's defaults, rather than the primary well- or better-balanced ones.

The human sensory bandwidth is well known to be finite. I saw one
estimate that put the bandwidth of the optic nerves at 1e6 bits/s, the
auditory nerves at 1e4 bits/s, and tactile nerves at 1e2 bits/s.

Thus as computer display technology improves in bandwidth and resolution,
it must at some point saturate the sensory bandwidth of the observer.
Since computer technology is progressing at a rate we can predict with
some confidence for perhaps the next decade or two, we should be able to
guess with some accuracy when the saturation will occur.

This morning, while we were having breakfast, my 3-year-old son Jeff
decides he's going to tell me one of his favorite riddles:

	Jeff: Daddy?
	Me: Yes, Jeff?
	Jeff: Daddy, why did the chicken cross the road?
	Me: Why?
	Jeff (smiling in anticipation): To get to the other side.

Jeff then leaned over real close to me with his eyes wide open, and
whispered ``But first, he made sure to look to the left and then to the
right to make sure no cars were coming!''

On the Mac, all programs are basically editors.  This is not always the

%
Near the end of the chapter, he includes this paragraph:

  ``You, as the compiler writer, must decide if it's worth the risk of
    doing this kind of optimization.  It's difficult for the compiler to
    distinguish between the safe and dangerous cases, here.  For example,
    many C compilers perform risky optimizations because the compiler
    writer has assumed the that a C programmer can understand the problems
    and take steps to remedy them at the source code level.  It's better
    to provide the maximum optimization, even if it's dangerous, than to
    be conservative at the cost of less efficient code.''

I was shocked.  My optimizer friends were shocked.  I didn't show it to
my Scheme or ML friends as it would have confirmed their worst
suspicions about compilers and compiler writers.

When I was teaching compiler courses ten years ago, my inclination was

Given the way that the NeXT is designed with respect to menus, it would
be difficult to just allow focus on cursor as a preference.  Think of a
screen setup where there is no background path from where your cursor is
to where the application's menu is.  This means that you would have to
potentially cross windows from other applications.  As you do, you focus
in turn on each window along your cursor path.  By the time your cursor
gets to the menu area, the menu you are interested in is long gone.

buy a few more Gigabytes of memory for the expanding cray-2 cluster.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-
bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have
chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.

The argument goes something like this: ``I refuse to prove that I exist,''
says God, ``for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.''

``But,'' says Man, ``the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it?  It could
not have evolved by chance.  It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your
own arguments, your don't.  QED.''

``Oh dear,'' says God, ``I hadn't thought of that,'' and promptly vanishes
in a puff of logic.

Consider Rube Goldberg's design for a "simplified" pencil sharpener.
It starts with a string attached to a kite flying outside a window.
When the window is opened, the string lifts the door on a cage filled
with moths allowing them to escape and eat a red flannel shirt hanging
above the cage.  As the weight of the shirt decreases, a shoe (attached
to the top of the shirt via a string through a pulley) becomes heavier
than the shirt and starts to move downward, flipping a power switch
on.  When the power goes on, an iron on top of some pants on an ironing
board burns a hole in the pants, creating smoke which enters a hole in
a tree trunk next to the ironing board, smoking out an opossum which
jumps into a basket from a higher hole in the tree, pulling a rope that
lifts a cage door allowing a woodpecker to chew the wood from the pencil
exposing the lead....

There is a popular word processor which was originally written in assembly.
They decided to invest a lot of money to produce a C version (to which end,
they hired a lot of C 'gurus' so as not to be handicapped by lack of experience
with the language).  They confidently predicted the C version would be ready
before the next release of the assembly version and would be nearly as fast.
The C version actually took longer to write than the next _two_ major assembly
version upgrades.  The C version is considerably slower as well (like doing
a global search and having to wait 10 seconds instead of instant response -
the kind of thing that wastes considerable time for anyone unfortunate enough
to be forced to use it).  It is true that the C version has been ported to
other machines - but what is the good of that?  All they have is a slow word
processor on more than one platform - it doesn't compete well with the native
products on any machine.  Meanwhile, their assembly version still sells well.
As far as I can tell, this is a typical experience.

The Question to the Answer to the Great Question of Life,
the Universe, and Everything....

 1. The Answer to the Question is 42.

 2. Marvin, amongst numerous other complaints, claimed to have a brain the
    size of a planet.

 3. Marvin, like other robots, has a computer-based brain.

 4. The Earth is a planet.

 5. The Earth was built by the mice as a computer, the only such planet or
    computer ever built.

 6. By (2), (3), (4), and (5), the Earth must therefore be Marvin's brain.

 7. The sole purpose of the Earth's program was to discover the Great
    Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

 8. Marvin once announced that he had, in a moment of boredom, found the
    square root of -1, something never before done in the history of the
    universe, and previously believed by all sensible hyper-intelligent
    beings to be possibly the most difficult task to undertake, as it was
    dependent on the very structure of the Universe. (Most normally-
    intelligent beings gave up, dismissing it as impossible)

 9. Marvin announced that he felt a brief, but deep, sense of satisfaction
    after having accomplished the achievement in (8).

10. The Earth was apparently destroyed just as the purpose of its program
    was fulfilled, and a Question was found.

11. By (7), the Earth computer would have felt a deep sense of satisfaction

The standard attempt to infer this states that one must read the standard

implementation-defined effects, and so nothing can be said about how the

a precise quantity anyway.

10     J = J + I

Ben Darnstein says: Yes it is!  Just make the following trivial change:
main()
{
    fortran_interpreter("
       DO 10 I = 1,10
10     J = J + I
       END
");
}

fortran_interpreter(char *s) { ... }

Early reports from the Persian Gulf have sung the praises of our
smart weapons.  The cruise missiles would first stop by the Baghdad
Post Office to see if the target had filed a change of address,
then head down the main boulevard, carefully observing all traffic
lights.  Upon reaching the target, the missile would knock on the
door, display the correct password to gain entrance, and penetrate
deeply into the building before detonating.

It may seem that if a popular application 'pokes' the operating system and
otherwise engages in unsavory practices that the authors or users of the
application will suffer because a future release, such as OS/2, may not run the
application correctly.  To the contrary, the market dynamics state that the
application has now set a standard, and it's the operating system developers
who suffer because they must support that standard.  Usually, that 'standard'
operating system interface is not even known; a great deal of experimentation
is necessary to discover exactly which undocumented side effects, system
internals, and timing relationships the application is dependent on.

The problem with the X windowing system, I have learned, is the
incredible FREEDOM it gives idiot users to CUSTOMIZE everything.
They discover the list of POSSIBLE COLORS in that repellent file,
and then they USE as many of them as they can.

Note that literally millions of colors are available, and have been
all along.  It's something about the way X lists a few of them that
ENCOURAGES IDIOTS TO USE THEM.

"Hey!  I think MiamiPink window borders would look fetching with
CornflowerBlue window panes," they say.  "And my background should
be BrightMustard."  Then they do it.

I don't know why whenever someone meets another person they don't like they
always accuse the person of coming from Hell.  Hell, Michigan is a pleasant
little village of about 800 residents about thirty miles northwest of Ann
Arbor and about thirty miles due south of the Howell exit on I-96, at the
southern end of Livingston County on State Highway 106 in the Pickney State
Forest.  I've been through Hell and the residents there are real friendly
people.  The US Weather Bureau had a station there for many years that issued
reports during the winter indicating Hell had frozen over.  If you ever find
yourself going through Hell and back, be sure to stop in the little tourist
shop there which sells T-shirts, coffee mugs and such with the inscription
"I've been through Hell" on them.

taken sides in the dispute; IBM believes the Dutch invented it, Apple
sides with the Danes, thus the reason why no Apple products are allowed

My interest in video games is they're a highly visible example of
reliable real-time interactive control systems.  On a smaller scale,
they're what things like SDI ("Star Wars") are about.  You might
say it's unfair to compare hacked up video game systems with highly
planned military systems written in Ada.  It's true.  The odds are
stacked in favor of video games.  They're smaller and less complex.

Interesting concept.  Getting an out of print book from the library.
Paying the "lost book" fine is kinda a pain though.  I personally go
to the used book stores.  Much more straightforward to simply buy the
book than to check it out and then "lose" it.

rubber molecules when you go over a bump, or you could be in deep water.
You have to understand the factors causing ball bearings to wear out, and
how the tubes are welded together, and so many other details it's just too

[ENOBANDWDTH] - No Band Width Left: An asynchronous signal was caught (such
as SIGBALLOT, SIGPLSCOMMENT or SIGMORE2RD; see the description of <signal.h>
in 3.3.1) while the programmer process was busy dealing with the last such
signal.  The current handler shall be interrupted after attempting to save
context, and the new handler begins to execute.  Signals shall continue to
be delivered, interrupting one another, until {_POSIX_LAST_STRAW} is
reached.  (See description of Run-Time Randomly Varying Values in 2.8.4.1;
Please note sysconf() always returns either a value of one greater than the
true value at any particular time, or the return value from rand().)  Once
the true value of {_POSIX_LAST_STRAW} is reached, the entire precarious
stack comes clattering down.  The last interrupt handler with enough context
to still maintain some semblance of integrity returns [ENOBANDWDTH].  A
programmer process may attempt to notify its parent process of the condition
in an implementation defined way, but it shall be ignored.

I've no idea what a "portable C programmer" might be.  My wife can't lift me
off the ground, so I'm probably not even luggable.  But I _am_ a C programmer,
*EVEN WHEN I DON'T WANT TO BE*.
- The Fortran compiler I use is f2c (the vendor's compiler is priced beyond
  our interest level)
- I am seriously considering changing from the vendor's Pascal compiler to
  p2c (the optimizer's constant propagation code firmly believes that
  procedure passed as parameters to other procedures are never called, so
  that variables they set -- and *exist* to set -- are unaffected); I may
  even do my own p2c
- The Ada compiler I use is AdaEd, which is built on C
- The Scheme systems I use are built on top of C.
- Want to guess what the Prolog systems I use are built on?

If the virtual machine is truly to be a virtual version of the "real"
machine, you need more than just an address space mapping that looks
like the real machine. For example, if the real machine has supervisor
and protected modes, then the virtual machine must be able to be in
virtual protected mode or virtual supervisor mode. If the real machine
has hardware to support virtual memory, then the virtual machine must
have virtual hardware to support virtual virtual memory. Et cetera.

You don't Quit a document in PenPoint, you turn away from it in the
Notebook or close it if it's floating.  Quit doesn't fit the model.

Tell the user to select the Contents tab by writing a plus on it, then
create a hyperlink button for it.  But, why not tap on the Contents tab

one do you want to reopen, if any?  It's a lot easier to leave the user in

NETHERLANDS. Strict rationing of asterisks has been imposed in
Amsterdam today, as the shortage of the valuable ASCII character

# T F  The best way to get your child to behave in the supermarket
#      is to beat it and threaten it with the wrath of strangers.

The best way to get your child to behave in the supermarket is to give

# T F  A healthy child can watch more than 8 hours of tv a day.

To be healthy, a child must watch at least 8 hours of Roxette videos a

Garfield, The Simpsons and The Commitments.  These videos contain minute
quantities of Koolamines, which are as essential to mental health as
vitamins are to correct bodily function.

Broadcast TV contains deadly Budgetamins which poison the system and can
lead to Budgetosis, paralysis and brain death.  This is especially true
of The Terry Wogan Show, which is dangerous even behind TV shop windows.

1 bowl of Fruit Corner with fresh strawberries and sliced nectarine
1 bacon croissant with sweetcorn relish and fresh tomato

# T F  It's okay to lie to your teenager, and make up all kinds of

On my Classic, Typist+ works sort of OK with two big provisos.
Firstly, when Typist runs a OCR, it *requires* you to already be

text its going to send a pile of keyboard events to the foreground
application.  This means you need at least enough RAM for the System,
your text processor, and the Typist application to run at the same time.
Secondly, you need to book your holiday before you do any scanning.

introduction of struct returns in the 1970s.  Yet it shows up today, in

We no longer use Apollos around here, but there was a known bug with
the 'system' library call.  Under certain circumstances it thrashed the
stack, including the return address.  Easy fix to this was to pad the
stack by declaring an character array of size 12 or 16 (3-4 longwords
would do it) to protect the return address.  I found this out while
debugging some assembler code, and when a friend was writing code along
the lines of

  int foobar(char *str)
  {
    /* stuff */
    return system(str);
  }

things just wouldn't work out.  I asked him to rewrite the code as:

  int foobar(char *str)
  {
    char magic[12];
    /* stuff */
    return system(str);
  }

and things would work, proving that you can't take magic out of your program.
Several years after that I still see people add magic to programs using
'system', not knowing why, but stating that it can't hurt.

Turns out that in a threaded interpreter like Perl 5 you have to have
three operations besides those that produce the arguments.  The first one
decides whether to evaluate the first argument or the second, depending
on the context and maybe the state of the flip-flop.  The second one
decides whether to just evaluate the second argument because of list
context, or perhaps to flip the flip-flop and then maybe evaluate the
second argument because the flip-flop just flipped, and we want to see
if we should flop it immediately.  The third operation either does the
range in list context, or checks to see if we should flop the flip-flop.

Unix C-kermit from Columbia to my work host, transfer both to 486 via zmodem,
compile C-kermit for SysV, get Apple kermit *to* the Apple *without* a comm
program to receive it (a nice trick), get it working, dream up a gettydefs
entry for 486 serial port to the Apple, start Apple kermit, log into Unix
from Apple, invoke C-kermit server, shoot file over.  It took almost a week

Incidentally, scumbag is a noun rather than an adjective, and is not commonly
used in real English-speaking countries.  Asshole is properly spelled
arsehole, British is a proper noun and should obviously be capitalised.
Offense is spelled offence in this context, chap is not a substitute
for guys and can only be applied to males (presumably about half of the
readers of this newsgroup are females), rigormortis is actually rigour
mortis, pompous does not have an extra 'u'.  Otherwise excellent grammar

DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961.  At that time
DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape." Since then, the idea of an on-line
debugging program has propagated throughout the computer industry.
DDT programs are now available for all DEC computers. Since media
other than tape are now frequently used, the more descriptive name
"Dynamic Debugging Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT
acronym. Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (C(14)H(9)CL(5)), should be minimal since
they attack different, and apparently mutually exclusive, classes of bugs.

Courier is symbolic of a pernicious social inequality. For almost 2 generations,
Courier has been the preferred font for business correspondence in which a man

types it neatly and legibly in Courier, and then hands it back to the man for
his illegible signature, which nevertheless legitimates the document. An
interesting, though distressing, matrix of power, gender, and legibility.

English is a straightforward, frank, honest, open-hearted, no-nonsense
language, which has little truck with such devilish devious devices as
accents; indeed U.S. editors and printers are often thrown into a dither
when a foreign word insinuates itself into the language.
However there is one word on which Americans seem to have closed ranks,
printing it confidently, courageously, and almost invariably
complete with accent---the cheese presented to us as M\"unster.
Unfortunately, Munster doesn't take an accent.

I've seen wallpaper long functions that must have been knitted together
by a desparate programmer, heavily obfuscated one liners that claimed
to manage distributed databases, clumsiness of all kinds and sorts,
no matter how long, short, fat or thin those identifier names were.
Code without a single comment in sight and code deeply hidden in novels
of comments that were fun to read but had nothing to do with the subject.
I've read real gems too, and all that code used sht_nms, or cryptic42xy_
names, NamesSoVeryLongThatTheyBarelyFittedOnOneSingleLineOnMyScreen,
names that were very mnemonic and self explanatory and names that must
have been invented by the cat passing by and walking over the keyboard.

Most people use the term "real-time" rather loosely [....].  A "real-time"
system, in their minds, is just one that needs to be "quick as a bunny".
If they fail to meet that constraint, their users might be inconvenienced
or even annoyed.  When we use that term, it means something rather different.

We build systems that reside in a small telemetry computer, equipped with
all kinds of sensors that measure electromagnetic fields and changes in
temperature, sound, and physical disturbance.  We analyze those signals
and transmit the results back to a remote computer over a wide-band channel.
Our computer is at the end of a one-meter long bar and at the other end is
a nuclear device.  We drop them together down a big hole in the ground and
when the device detonates our computer collects data on the leading edge
of the blast.  The first two-and-a-quarter milliseconds after detonation
are the most interesting.  Of course, long before millisecond three, things
have gone downhill badly for our little computer.  We think of _THAT_ as a
real-time constraint.

By the way, the reading research upon which the design of
Century Schoolbook was supposedly based was conducted around
the time of World War I, and Century Schoolbook was released
in 1919.  It is possible that there have been a few advances
in reading research in the past 75 years, and that the stuff
that Morris Fuller Benton consulted might be thought
erroneous by today's researchers.  However, if you like
Century Schoolbook, don't worry, as it is likely that the
designer followed the venerable type design tradition of
ignoring most of what the scientists had to say.  Of course,
the scientists who developed most of today's digital font
formats followed the inverse tradition.

In 1986, the ZONE (Zealot Of Name Edification) program was written.
ZONE was originally intended to be used during the host-table-to-DNS

of all the information it collected.  This host table could then be used
by sites that had not yet made the DNS transition.  However, ZONE was
never used for this purpose.  Instead, it was used to produce a wall-size
chart of the domain tree.  Unfortunately, the number of domains quickly
outgrew the size of the wall and the charts had to be abandoned.

        The teeth that bite, the Claus that catch.
        Beware the Subjects bird, and shred

        And stood a while in thought.

        And as in selfish thought he stood,

        And troubled as it came!

of typical INTP reactions to each type of religion identified by the kit.
Users of INTP-rel 2000 will be able to take the religion of their choice,
analyze it, then determine what a typical INTPs reaction to it would be.

striking in details like funds "disappearing" at the end of the fiscal year

\underriverline whenever the anticlockwise Circle Line is closed on account
of a security alert, the double-straddle doesn't happen.  (More precisely,
plural straddles are passed back to the operating system and generate an
error message).

Note that the most popular of the current implementations of TraX, namely
LaTraX, can only handle one security alert per game.  I was following the

One will also see references to "real-time" systems when what is meant
is just "fast".  It might be worth pointing out that "real-time" is not
necessarily synonymous with "fast"; that is, it is not the latency of the
response per se that is at issue (it could be of the order of seconds),
but the fact that a bounded latency sufficient to solve the problem at
hand is guaranteed by the system.  In particular, frequently, algorithms
that guarantee bounded latency responses are less efficient overall than
algorithms that don't.

You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the
side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes
in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the
side thats been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes
you get men still in and not out. When a man goes out to go in, the men who
are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in
goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the
time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been
in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the
men have been in, including those who are not out, that's the end of the game!

Men's skin is different from women's skin.  It is usually bigger, and
it has more snakes tattooed on it.  Also, if you examine a woman's skin
very closely, inch by inch, starting at her shapely ankles, then gently
tracing the slender curve of her calves, then moving up to her ...
	[EDITOR'S NOTE: To make room for news articles about important
	 world events such as agriculture, we're going to delete the
	 next few square feet of the woman's skin.  Thank you.]
... until finally the two of you are lying there, spent, smoking your
cigarettes, and suddenly it hits you: Human skin is actually made up of
billions of tiny units of protoplasm, called "cells"!  And what is even
more interesting, the ones on the outside are all dying!  This is a fact.
Your skin is like an aggressive modern corporation, where the older veteran
cells, who have finally worked their way to the top and obtained offices with
nice views, are constantly being shoved out the window head first, without
so much as a pension plan, by younger hotshot cells moving up from below.

The only things known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy,
according to the philosopher Ly Tin Weedle.  He reasoned like this: you
can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap
between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the
heir *instantaneously*.  Presumeably, he said, there must be some elementary
particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course
succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle,
or republicon.  His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages,
involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the
signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed.

and sumptuous icons.  Everyone has a right to salvation.  Dos is Protestant,
or even Calvinistic. It allows free interpretation of scripture, demands
difficult personal decisions, imposes a subtle hermeneutics upon the user,
and takes for granted the idea that not all can reach salvation.  To make the
system work you need to interpret the program yourself: a long way from the
baroque community of revellers, the user is closed within the loneliness of
his own inner self.

houten stokken en dingen, helemaal door elkaar en aan al die stokken en dingen
zitten groene floepertjes gelijmd, maar ze zitten niet al te goed vastgeplakt,
want als het in de herfst gaat regenen dan wordt die lijm nat en lost op met
het gevolg dat al die floepertjes dan van die stokken en dingen afkukelen,
wat weer een enorme rotzooi op straat geeft. Soms hebben ze zo'n paal niet

Junior school childeren can count to a million; secondary school kids have

numbers by letters, so much so that they have begun to run out of Roman
letters and have to use Greek letters like pi and alfa; at University, the
only numbers you ever see are 0, 1 and 8, except that it's written on its
side, pronounced `infinity' and means `lots'. By this time all the letters of
the alphabet have long since been used up, the Greek alphabet is just about
accounted for, and those working in set theory have to start on the Hebrew
alphabet and use alephs and gimuls.

Het allerergste wat ik kan bedenken is dat ik altijd bij haar in de klas blijf
zitten, en pas van school af mag als ik met haar ga trouwen.  En dat we gearmd
door de Voorstraat lopen en iedereen ons ziet.  En dat ze me dan n\'og slaat.
Dat is erger dan doodgaan, doodgeschoten worden, verdrinken, verbranden en
omkomen in een woestijn bij elkaar opgeteld.  En dat ze me zoent.

Changes in inews version 666.13
===============================

This is mainly a bugfix release. The one user visible change is that the
handling of signature files has altered. For many years inews has truncated
the signature at 4 lines. Since the net became fashionable and the latest
`WAY COOL' thing to do, the massive influx of clueless dorks has stretched
this restriction to breaking point. The author of inews has got fed up with
endless email from naive users complaining about the 4 line limit and has
decided to stop trying to piss into the wind. Now the default action is to
expand signature files <= 4 lines in length using a random selection from
an online file of cow jokes and bad ascii art. Use of the -K option will
append Kibo's signature.  This option can be repeated, in which case Kibo's
signature will be appended multiple times, randomly quoted, followed by
one line saying "Me too!" to get a good approximation to being a subscriber
of AOL.  The previous behavior of truncating to 4 lines can be obtained by
using the -McQ option.

Fuzzy bunny is a game in which people sit around in a circle, and, one at

has to say `fuzzy bunny' and pass the bag of marshmellows to the next person.
Whoever can stuff the most marshmellows in their mouth wins.

DEAR ANDY: I've got a tip for all of your readers who can't keep their cats
off their laser printers. I had this problem with my feline companion, Mr.
Whiskers, and after months of frustrating failure (I even tried saying "NO!!"
to Mr. Whiskers in a stern voice, if you can believe that!), I hit upon a simple
solution: I went to my local Apple dealer and bought Mr.  Whiskers a LaserWriter
of his very own! It's PostScript, ofcourse, because Mr. Whiskers can sense
a QuickDraw printer a mile away.  To make sure Mr. Whiskers would jump only
on _his_ LaserWriter, I had to pay someone to make mine run at a much lower
temperature. My printer now doesn't really print very well, actually, but I'm
thrilled to report that Mr. Whiskers is now a happy, happy feline companion!
		-- Signed: Purr-fect in Little Neck
DEAR PURR-FECT: I ran your suggestion by Dr. Sylvia Macpherson, a feline
psychologist, who suggests that you may be denying your cat the mental
stimulation it seeks. "Cats are smarter than dogs, no question," she explained.
"But whereas Fido lives in a fool's paradise, so to speak, Felix is just barely
smart enough to realize exactly how little he actually knows. His acute senses
tell him that a wheelbarrow of information and ideas are being fed to that box
in the corner, and since Being Fed is one of the few concepts a cat can readily
understand, it hops right up on the printer, hoping to pick up any scraps of
intelligence that might fall to the ground. As far as we can tell, none ever do.
"Which is probably just as well," Macpherson continued, "because, I mean, cats
wouldn't know what to do with all that data even if you hardwired an AppleTalk
port right into their skulls. Oh damn". At that point, we were disconnected.

I just wanted to point out that the most Algol-like language of all, viz.
Algol-68, makes no such distinction.  Procedures that "return" void are
not interestingly different from procedures that "return" anything else.
I put "return" in quotes because, of course, in Algol there are no
"return statements";  you just get out of a procedure whatever its "unit"
gives you.  This is so simple and obvious that most Algol-like languages
after 1968 felt the need to do something different [and worse].

Christmas 95 is scheduled for release in December of 1995, though one unnamed
source said that it is dangerously close to the end of the year and may slip
into the first half of 1996.  An economist at Goldman Sachs explained that a
slip would be catostrophic to next year's economy and the nation's tax
revenue, possibly requiring the IRS to move the deadline for filing income
tax returns to three months after Christmas, whenever that was.  "But it
could be good in the long term," he explained. "With Microsoft controlling
Christmas, we may see it move to May or June, which are much slower months
for retailers.  This may serve to even out the economy over the year."

A: The click usually results from the power saving system that shuts off the

   making silence (playing a silent sound), but you have to remember that

Last I heard short division in the NYC public schools is the topic for an
entire year.  The next year students get long division.  My own daughters
spent much of that time looking for the deep thought that had to be there
because they'd caught on the first week and couldn't understand what was taking
so long.  Children of friends who understood at first, stopped understanding
because they did not understand what was being driven at, over and over again.
%
A cousin of mine, quite young at the time, confided to me that she was having
enormous trouble learning "short" division.  I checked my pockets and found
48 cents and put them on the table in front of us.  I asked her how much
would be her share if she "split" it among her brothers and sisters (there
are four sibling).  She immediately replied "twelve cents".  "Aha!," I said,
"you do know short division."  "No," she said, "you gave me a money problem.
I can do money problems.  In school we have to do guzintas."  "Guzintas?"

       ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT

I have been one acquainted with the night,
I have walked out in rain - and back in rain,
I have outwalked the farthest city light,

I have looked down the saddest city lane,
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stoppes the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,
But not to call me back or say good-by;
And further stilll at an unearthly height
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right,
I have been one, acquainted with the night.

You always learn something by reading the classics.  Particularly The
Prince.  I go through and look at this from this intellectual point of
view.  Machiavelli had these three classes of mind.  The first class was
the person that was creative enough to be leader and be able to lead a
great nation without much help.  The second class of mind was one that
wasn't creative but could take ideas, put people around him, and be able
to lead nations forward.  And the third class of people didn't really know
much of anything.  And they were the worst kind of leaders, because not
only were they not creative, but they didn't know what was right or wrong,
and they just sort of went by whatever they felt like.
I've tried to figure out where I am.  I know I'm not the first because I don't
think I have the creativeness that Machiavelli talks about.  If I go back and
reread it I might figure it out exactly where I put myself.  I'm somewhere
between two and one.

Arkansas. He's going to put Senator Al Gore in charge of the environmental
summit and his book will be the agenda for that environmental summit.

that's the agenda for Bill Clinton.  That's the agenda of the Clinton-Gore

diminishes me because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never
send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.

bed with a poisoning of the blood in a different wing of the hospital with
three former visitors to other pations in the hospital who had also come
down with serious staphylococcus infections and who, for all Yossarian knew,
might be private detectives also. Yossarian could have told all four of them

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a rapping,
As of someone gently tapping, tapping at my chamber door;
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "rapping at my chamber door,
Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor;
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had tried to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,
For that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
Nameless here for evermore.

But the silken, sad, uncertain rustlig of the purple curtain
Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before,
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger--hesitating then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore,
But the fact is I was napping, and so faintly you came tapping,
And so gently you came rapping, rapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door--
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before,
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo whispered back the word "Lenore!"
Only this and nothing more.

Then into that chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon there came again a tapping somewhat louder than before;
"Surely," I said, "surely that is something at my window lattice--
Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore--
'Tis the wind and nothing more!"

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he--not an instant stopped or stayed he--
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
Perched upon the bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Soon this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grim and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to bear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore--
For we cannot help agreeing that no sublunary being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door--
With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that word did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before--
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Wondering at the silence broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his hopes one burden bore--
Till the dirges of his hope one melancholy burden bore
Of "Never--nevermore."

But the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door,
Then, into the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore--
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from some unseen censer,
Swung by angels whose faint footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor;
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore--
Let me quaff this kind nepenthe and forget the lost Lenore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet," said I, "thing of evil! Prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether Tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted--on this home by horror haunted--
On this desert land enchanted--tell me--tell me, I implore--
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me truly, I implore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet," said I, "thing of evil! Prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven which bends above us--by that God we both adore--
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting,
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken--
Leave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and thy form from off my door!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

And that Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door,
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor,
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted--nevermore!
		-- E. A. Poe, "The Raven"

Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.  The

Calvin: Let's see what you drew for Art class, Susie.
        Well, a tidy little domestic scene. A house
        in a yard with flowers. How typically female.
        Girls think small and are preoccupied with
        petty details. But BOYS think BIG! Boys think
        about action and accomplishment! No wonder
        it's MEN who change the world!!

Susie:  Hi, Calvin. I brought Mr. Bun over so we can
        play house. You and I can be the parents,
        and Hobbes and Mr. Bun can be our children.
Calvin: Oh, right. Hobbes and I are gonna put our
        big plans on hold so we can play house with
        a stuffed rabbit? Forget it!
Susie:  I don't see why you'll play with your dumb
        ol' tiger and not with Mr. Bun and me!

Uncle Ike saw her first: just an ordinary chicken, he thought for a
moment, a chicken picking here and pecking there, gradually working
her way across the road toward the lawn; but then he felt the fingers
tighten on his arm and looked up, astounded, to see him, the Colonel,
eyes lit with a new fire, face aglow like a saint seeing a vision: and
then it was destiny, a thing pre-ordained, a fatality, for the Colonel
did not reveal even to him, Uncle Ike, the secret ingredients, not the
names of the herbs and not even the number of them, and so the secret
of the crust remained, a hermetic mystery, locked in the private places
of the Colonel's soul: and yet the vision was real, a true moment of
Fate; for the franchises sold almost as fast as they could slaughter and
gut the stock, and they spread across the country, across the civilized
world, making the Colonel not just a millionaire but a billionaire, and
Uncle Ike saw it all, knew it all, from the beginning to the day when
the initials KFC were to be seen in every city, every town, every hamlet
large enough to own two mules and an Assembly of God church: until now,
standing in the shop in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, where Flem
Snopes, the bank president, hawked and coughed and spat on the floor,
then hoisted his britches, country style, and said to the waitress,

een mooie folder: "Algemene Voorwaarden" (NMBS conducteur begint te
giechelen).  Blader, blader, blader... "Verdomd! U heeft gelijk! Wat
een rare voetnoot!!!".

Wat nu HC? "Gewoon, niets aan de hand, ik vind het best." Ja, ho!,
hoor eens even, ik wil een vervangend biljet dat *wel* geldig
is. "Eehhh... Ehhh...  *KNERK*" (NMBS conducteur ligt *volkomen* in de

Zo'n Grote Overkoepelende Theorie is alleen maar een bombastische naam voor
de kapstok waar fysici graag alle vier de krachten die ze onderscheiden in
de natuur tegelijk aan op willen hangen. Twee hangen er al een tijdje, de
elektromagnetische kracht en de zwakke kracht, een kracht die een rol speelt
bij radioactieve processen. De derde, de sterke kracht of de kernkracht,
lijkt er ook af en toe aan te blijven hangen, maar flikkert er telkens weer
vanaf, en de zwaartekracht wil helemaal niet. Maar stel dat ze alle vier
gezusterlijk in het halletje hingen, kun je dan ineens uitrekenen waarom
een kikker groen is? Of waarom je haar gaat groeien als je yoghurt op je
kale kop smeert terwijl een persoon in een witte jas je verteld heeft dat
het een haargroeimiddel is? Doet u mij eerst maar eens de golffunctie van

Excuse me, Mr. postgraduate, but it's "Woerterbuch", umlaut over the "o".
How about these examples: Einkommensverhaeltnisse, Festsetzungsbescheid,
and Betriebskrankenkasse? These were *all* included in a nice letter I
received from a government agency last week. I'm still trying to figure

Buy a cat. Feed it every morning at 7:30 or whenever it is that you need to
get up. Then throw out your cheesey $8 alarm clock. Your cat will take its place
handily. No more oversleeping-- your cat doesn't have a snooze bar! Your cat
can't be turned off. You can't forget to set your cat the night before. Even if
you leave your cat outside, it will pound on your window until you wake up.

Your cat has a series of alarm modes with gradually increasing signal intensity:

     soft meows
     insistent meows
     insistent meows three inches from your face
     pats on your cheek
     four heavy paws planted in your chest
     claws in your face

All this, for the cost of shots, neutering, assorted vet bills, and one can of
Nine Lives a day for the next 12 years

You can't, you won't and you don't stop
Mike D come and rock the sure shot

I've got the brand new doo-doo gauranteed like yoo hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yea Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey

Well, it's the taking of pelham, one, two, three
If you want a doodoo rhyme then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhyme and
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
Strictly hand held is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the panty hose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
'Cause at the boards is the man they call the Mario.
Pull up at the function and you know I kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozack
I've got more action than my man John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew

You can't, you won't and you don't stop
AD Rock come and rock the sure shot

Hurricane will cross fad on your ass and bust your ear drums
Listen everybody 'cause I'm shifting gears I'm
Fresh like Dougie when I get my specs and
On the microphone I come correct

Timing like a clock when I rock the hip hop
Top notch is my stock on the soap box
I've got more rhymes than I've got grey hairs
And that's alot because I've got my share
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
Got to straighten my thoughts, I'm thinking too much sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I've got to step back, I've got to contemplate
I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very
On rock the microphone and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a cheech wizard
Never quitting, so won't you listen?

Oh yes indeed, it's fun time
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
MCA come and rock the sure shot

I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and the friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well you say I'm twenty something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my coach watching my T.V.
I'm still listening to wax, i'm not using the cd
I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quitting
Think I'm gonna change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I've got the Ill Communications.

SCENE I:
--------

Beth sits in a lone chair before Jules and Vincent like a political
prisoner in front of an interrogator.  Jules takes another bite of
Beth's hamburger.

         JULES: You know that Marsellus Wallace has warned you
                before about posting .sigs like that on the net
                and you keep doing it.  Why is that Beth?

          BETH: What?

         JULES: You heard me!

          BETH: What?

Jules takes his .45 and presses the barrel HARD in Beth's cheek.

         JULES: Say "What" again!  C'mon, say "What" again!  I dare
                ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one
                more goddamn time!

Beth shits her pants.

          BETH: I don't know.

         JULES: Do you know how many lines long that .sig was?

          BETH: What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his eyes and
shoots Beth in the shoulder.

Beth screams, breaking into a shaking/trembling spasm in the chair.

         JULES: There's a passage I got memorized, seems
                appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17.
                "The path of the righteous man is beset on
                all sides by the inequities of the selfish
                and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he
                who, in the name of charity and good will,
                shepherds the weak through the valley of
                darkness, for he is truly his brother's
                keeper and the finder of lost children.
                And I will strike down upon thee with great
                vengeance and furious anger those who attempt
                to poison and destroy my brothers.  And you
                will know my name is the Lord when I lay my
                vengeance upon you."

Jules and Vincent empty their guns at the same time on Beth.  When they
are finished, the bullet-ridden carcass just sits there for a moment,
then topples over.  All is quiet.  Fade to black.

    It was then that she asked me, in a lowered tone, "Who's Jed?"
    She had seen me keyboard in my password--like HAL from _2001_.

glad I was able to tell someone at last.

She then said to me, "Dan, I have a question about identity for you. Here it
is: What is the one thing more than any other thing that makes one person
different from any other person?"
    I got all ready to blurt out an answer but then nothing came out of my
mouth.
    The question seemed so obvious to start with, but when I thought about
it, I realized how difficult it is--and sort of depressing, because there's
really not very much that distinguishes anyone from anyone else.

Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your
hand into a friend's mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.  Did you
notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?  This teaches
us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never use it
to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.

It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.  When you scuffed your
feet, you picked up batches of "electrons", which are very small objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.
The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,
where they form a spark that leaps to your friend's filling, then travels
down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.

Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without touching
anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger would explode!
But this is nothing to worry about unless you have carpeting.

On an innovative system like the Macintosh, programs don't look quite the
way they do on other systems. For example, instead of carrying out a sequence
of steps in a predetermined order, your program is driven by user actions (such
as clicking and typing) whose order cannot be predicted.

The best time to familiarize yourself with the user interface is before
beginning to design an application.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume I
%
To help people feel more comfortable with the applications, the applications
should build on skills that people already have, not force them to learn new
ones. The user should feel in control of the computer, not the other way around.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume I
%
Responsiveness means that the user's actions tend to have direct results. The
user should be able to accomplish what needs to be done spontaneously and
intuitively, rather than having to think: "Let's see; to do C, first I have
to do A and B and then...".
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume I
%
Permissiveness means that the application tends to allow the user to do
anything reasonable. The user, not the system, decides what to do next.

DO'S AND DON'TS OF A FRIENDLY USER INTERFACE

Do:
    * Let the user have as much control as possible over the appearance
      of objects on the screen--their arrangement, size, and visibility.
    * Use verbs for menu commands that perform actions.
    * Make alert messages self-explanatory.
    * Use controls and other graphics instead of just menu commands.
    * Take the time to use good graphic design; it really helps.
Don't:
    * Overuse modes, including modal dialog boxes.
    * Require using the keyboard for an operation that would be easier
      with the mouse, or require using the mouse for an operation that
      would be easier with the keyboard.
    * Change the way the screen looks unexpectedly, especially by scrolling
      automatically more than necessary.
    * Redraw object unnecessarily; it causes the screen to flicker annoyingly.
    * Make up your own menus and then give them the same names as
      standard menus.
    * Take an old-fashioned prompt-based application originally developed
      for another machine and pass it off as a Macintosh application.

QuickDraw lives up to its name: It's very fast. The speed and responsiveness of
the Macintosh user interface are due primarily to the speed of QuickDraw.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume I

The performance of QuickDraw in the 128K ROM has been enhanced considerably.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume IV

Color QuickDraw supports the use of as many as 2^48 colors. In addition, Color
QuickDraw's color model is hardware-independent.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume V

Color QuickDraw now supports pixel maps with direct pixel specification as well
as the indexed method supported by the original release of Color QuickDraw.
Since QuickDraw has always striven to be device-independent, many applications
need make no changes.

To create graphics that are both precise and pretty requires not supercharged
features but a firm mathematical foundation for the features you have. If the
mathematics that underlie a graphics package are imprecise of fuzzy, the
graphics will be, too.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume I
%
Different colors have standard associations in different cultures. "Meanings"
of colors usually have nothing to do with the wavelength of the color, but
are learned through conditioning within a particular culture.

Some of the more universal meanings for colors are

    * Red: stop, error or failure. (For disk drives, red also means disk
      access in progress; don't remove the disk or turn it off.).
    * Yellow: warning, caution or delay.
    * Green: go, ready, or power on.
    * Warm versus cold: reds, oranges, and yellows are perceived as hot
      or exciting colors, blues and greens are cool, calm colors.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume IV
%
Although the screen may be able to display 256 or more colors, the human
eye can discriminate only around 128 pure hues. Furthermore, when colors
are used to signify information, studies have shown that the mind can only
effectively follow four to seven color assignments on a screen at once.

A *pop-up menu* is one that isn't in the menu bar, but appears somewhere else

The primary test of the user interface is its success with users.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume IV
%
There is no such thing as a "typical user".
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume IV
%
Apple's goal in adding color to the desktop user interface is to add meaning,
not just to color things so they "look good". Color can be a valuable
additional channel of information to the user, but must be used carefully;
otherwise, it can have the opposite of the effect you were trying for, and
can be overwhelming visually (or look game-like).
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume V
%
*See-and-point (not remember-and-type).* Users rely on recognition, not recall,
so entities are visible when possible. People don't have to remember anything
the computer already knows, such as which commands are available.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume VI
%
*Consistency.* Effective applications are internally consistent
_and_ consistent with other applications.
		-- Inside Macintosh, Volume VI
%
Graphics have the potential to enhance your application, but they can also
be offensive. In addition to colors, many cultures assign varying values
and characteristics to living creatures, plants, and inanimate objects.

    Many geeks don't really have a sexuality--they just have work. I think
the sequence is that they get jobs at Microsoft or wherever right out of

just figure that the relationships will naturally happen, but then they
wake up and they're thirty and they haven't had sex in eight years. There
are always these flings at conferences and trade shows, and everyone brags
about them, but nothing seems to emerge from them and life goes back to the
primary relationship: Geek and Machine.

When the EU finally gets a unified currency, what will it be called?
Something other than Ecu, I hope.  Can one imagine the British
paying for beer or the Germans for bratwurst in Ecu and centiecu?
I propose "Mouton d'or", a name with a fine historical flavour.
Alternatively one could have "shillings" in England, "schilling"
in Germany, "scellini" in Italy, and to hell with the French.

First, it must be noted that while the Constitution will now say
that we cannot set flags on fire, it does NOT forbid us from setting
other things on fire. Like the Constitution. Or people. It does mean,
however, that before you go ignite the local veteran's home, you should
first sneak in and remove all the flags.

Second, when you see someone has desecrated the flag, there is no
problem with desecrating it further. This is just common sense. So
I plan to make a lot of money importing Pre-Desecrated Flags (tm).

It all started when the current engineers were in school at USC in the USA.
They didn't like to miss their favorite soap AMC, so MON thru FRI they
programmed their VHS VCR to record it on a TDK tape.  After class, they'd
stop at the ATM, enter their PIN and get cash to go buy some BUD.  Of course
they walked so they wouldn't be DWI. Then they'd sit around for hours doing
their SCI-101 homework while they listened to bands like REM, ELO, ELP,
and occasionally CCR.  All on DAT, of course.

They wanted jobs where they'd earn enough to support a MRS and still have
enough to pay the IRS every APR.  (Of course, ever since the ERA, some of
the engineers would become a MRS rather than supporting one.)  While working
for IBM they got involved with the beginnings of the Internet (quickly known
to then as the NET).  They worked hard, interfaced with the CPU and created
the WWW which quickly spread to all sites, both .COM and .EDU.  The GOP FTP'd
from their site at .GOV the information, but as happens when politicians get
confused, the TLA scheme got fouled up by the UN and NATO.

The AMA and AHA both want TLAs stopped PDQ before the EPA gets involved.

That's simple; the cloaking devices feed off human psionic energy.
This is easily available in cities (the only side-effects of diversion
of this energy being headaches, lethargy, increased hostility and
paranoid delusions).  In the countryside, they have to leech energy from
cows, which means that they are invisible only to cows as a consequence.

PLUTO thinks it gets the jokes. Pluto thinks its position on
the edge indicates status and respect. Pluto thinks the others
care about it. But nobody visits Pluto. Most don't even notice
Pluto. If Pluto went poof, the stability of the others would
barely twitch. One or two might ask, "Say, what happened
to...?" but the typical response would be "Who cares?"

In C, you shoot yourself in the foot.

In C++, you get confused over whether the 23 foot objects that appear
to be available are actual feet, or only pointers to feet elsewhere,
and end up shooting your own gun in its foot.

In Smalltalk, you send the message "shoot" to an instance of "gun"
with an argument of "myFoot", whereupon the system responds
"gunPowder doesNotUnderstand spark".  You spend two days browsing
through the class library looking at classes for  "Explosive" "Firearm"
and "IdealGas" among others, and eventually just make a subclass
of Foot called ShotFoot with an additional attribute of bulletHole.

In Austria PTT requires a modem to block a destination number if a

buglevel. And, of course, most modem manufacturers implement hidden
registers to circumvent the reuqired feature.

Sorry, that's my fault. I'm afraid that the high-energy laser-pumped

your microwave's control panel. It should work properly now. Also,
my cat Arthur was FTPing hundreds of terabytes of PD software from
Epsilon Eridani in the year 4741 A.D. over the faster-than-light
Ethernet interface I built for him, and this may have been loading

noticed any performance degradation.

BILLERICA, Massachusetts - For six months, a woman thought she was in

caller would never say a word.

The phone company eventually traced the calls to an abandoned oil tank
in Maryland. It was rigged to call the oil company when the oil level
was low, but the phone number was scrambled and it called her instead.

I heard this story from someone who worked for a French company, they
had a problem with a program on punched cards written for them by a US
subsidiary.  The programs never worked when loaded in France but the
US systems house swore blind that they did at their end.  Eventually,
in exasperation, someone followed the working set of cards from the US
to France.  At French customs, they observed a customs official remove
a few cards at random from the deck.  Apparently, the french customs
are entitled to remove a sample from any bulk item (such as grain), so
a few cards from a large consignment shouldn't matter, should it?

Several years ago a Colorado State professor of Mech Engr named Gerry
Johnson goes to an IBM networking exposition.  At this expo IBM is
demonstrating some kind of new networking software to link PCs to the
IBM global network.  Dr. Johnson being the savvy controls engineer
that he is asks for a demonstration of an unusual kind.  He knows that
the software will work in normal parameters, so he asks for something
only an idiot would.  He has the demo guy try to transfer a 50MB file
from a 370 a few miles away.  The catch is the PC has only a 20MB
drive.  Dr. J's argument is that if the software is written properly
it will error out and say what's wrong.  So they start the transfer
and *poof* down goes the PC and the 370.  The demo guy is apologetic
and asks Dr. J. to come back tomorrow, and he'll see if he can get
them to fix the problem overnight.  The next day Johnson comes back to
find the display boarded up.  A note says that the booth is closed due
to technical problems.  Later that day Johnson finds out why.  Not
only did the 370 and the local PC go down, IBM'S ENTIRE GLOBAL NETWORK
BIT THE DUST!  Every computer attached to it went off-line.  Months
later, it turns out that it wasn't the new networking software as they
had expected, but a bit of code in the 370 MVS operating system that
had never been executed in the entire 15yrs or so that it had been in
existence up to that date.

        Dear Reader,

        Due to a systemerror that we had this week, you have unfortunately
        been communicating with our ANCO-system (Adavnaced Neurosimulated
        Computerized Operating system) here at the dutch Geavanceerd

        ANCO is a six-th generation Artificial Intelligence system. It is
        still in beta-version. Only testers here at the development-site
        communicate with ANCO, however, a leak in the system, allows ANCO
        now to communicate with the whole internet community.

        We apologize for any inconvenience that has occurred so far. Any
        further communication with ANCO is for your own risk. Here at the
        lab we try to find the leak, to prevent any further mishappenings
        in the future.

        With kind regards,

In the last week I handed my credit card to a waiter who disappeared

I called a hotel and gave my card data to a reservation clerk and
continued my recklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing

with a small frown, "I'm afraid not."  Well, I said, would you let me
buy the recipe?

With a cute smile, she said, "Yes."  I asked how much, and she
responded, "Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to my tab.
Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from
Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had
only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I
glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe -
$250.00."  BOY, WAS I UPSET!! I called Neiman's accounting dept. and told
them the waitress said it was "two fifty," and I did not realize she
meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe.  I asked them to take back the recipe
and reduce my bill and they said they were sorry, but because all the
recipes were this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of
our bakery recipes....the bill would stand. I waited, thinking
of how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back.

I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to have
$250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to it that
every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus
for nothing. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "I'm
sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even," and I will.

So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few
copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.


                    (Recipe may be halved.)

      2  cups butter                     4  cups flower
      2  tsp. soda                       2  cups sugar
      5  cups blended oatmeal**         24 oz. chocolate chips
      2  cups brown sugar                1  tsp. salt
      1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)      4  eggs
      2  tsp. baking powder              3 cups chopped nuts (yourchoice)
      2  tsp. vanilla

        ** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
            Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla;
            mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and
            soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into
            balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake
            for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.

        Have fun!!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story..

I've come across two neat names for this that don't appear in any
lists I've seen:  (1) "atpersat," formed on the model of "ampersand";
(2) "sabatchka," which I'm told is the name for it in Russian
(accent on the second syllable)--means "little dog."  I've formed
the habit of calling it "atpersat"; now I'm trying to break that
habit in favor of sabatchka.

*NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT -- REDMOND, WA., 11/15/95*

Today in a press meeting Microsoft introduced Microsoft BugDoubler for
the Macintosh. "This great new programme will singlehandedly double the
rate at which your Mac crashes", claims Microsoft CEO B. Onehead.

Microsoft BugDoubler is now shipping free with all Microsoft products;
rumours claim less stable betaversions have been incorporated in various
Microsoft products for some years now.

I am using a mac 7500/100 powermac. There seemed to be no way to get
eudora to send mail. So, I fooled around for a short and the following
solution presented itself: when trying to send mail, sign off, sign back
on, when asked for password, type in anything, error will show up, no
such password or something similar, depending on your server, turn on
balloon help, turn off all screens except harddrive, leave cursor
somewhere on harddrive screen, hit OPEN APPLE "T". This sends my mail.
I have spoken to my server about it and they do not know why it works,
it may not work for  anyone else, but it is the only way I have been
able to get Eudora to work for me.

Back when I was in college (many many years ago), we had an HP 2000 Time
Shared Basic system.  It was a fairly primitive system by current standards
(16 TTY terminals), but the neatest thing since sliced bread at the time.
There were several students, however, who just did not get along well with
computers.  One of these, a classmate of mine, had spent several hours
creating a program to do some task, but the program was not working as
expected.  In a fit of frustration, the student typed in "SCR*W YOU" on the
TTY.  However it was the student who was screwed. Any line not prefixed by a
line number was interpreted by the system as a command, and the system
ignored anything beyond the first three letters of commands.  So "SCR*W YOU"
was seen as "SCR", meaning "scratch" -- the system's command to erase the
current workspace.

In a final bit of irony, the system responded with its usual response --
"OK" -- after completing the "scratch" operation.  The student was laughing
at the system's response -- until he realized his program had disappeared.

  In fact the only things in the flat Crowley devoted
any personal attention to were the houseplants. They
were huge and green and glorioius, with shiny, healty,
lustrous leaves.
  This was because, once a week, Crowley went around
the flat with a green plastic plant mister, spraying the
leaves, and talking to the plants.
  He had heard about talking to plants in the early
seventies, on Radio Four, and thought it an excellent
idea. Although _talking_ is perhaps the wrong word for
what Crowley did.
  What he did was put the fear of God into them.
  More precisely, the fear of Crowley.
  In addition to which, every couple of months Crowley
would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or
succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look
quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around
to all the others. `Say goodbye to your friend,' he'd
say to them. `He just couldn't cut it...'
  Then he would leave the flat with the offending plant,
and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower
pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously
around the flat.
  The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and
beautiful in London. Also the most terrified.

evil flourishes, and is, most indefensibly, defended.  But because
goodness is no longer a respectable aim in life.  The hound of hell,

There sure are, but noone's hushing up. May I quote a CERT Advisory:

        - exploiting the rpc.ypupdated vulnerability to gain root access
        - exploiting the loadmodule vulnerability to gain root access
        - installing Trojan horse programs and packet sniffers
        - launching IP spoofing attacks

So they're here, but, as I understand it, we have to prevent that they
root. CERT even has useful tips on that.

32-bit Cleanliness Is Mandatory

68K Macintosh computers can be set to use only the lower 24
bits of an address. In contrast, the PowerPC processor-based
Macintosh computers will use all 32 bits of a memory
address.

Most developers have removed dependencies on a 24-bit
environment, but some are using the upper bit of an address
of the 32-bits for other purposes. If you are doing this, be
aware that your code is only 31-bit clean. It will not work
on PowerPC.

We really mean it: 32-bit clean means 32-bit clean!

I saw a video tape that we weren't supposed to see. It was prepared for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By watching the tape, we discovered that, at
least as of a few years ago, every tactical nuclear weapon in Europe
manned by U.S. personnel was targeted by an Apple II computer. Now, we
didn't sell computers to the military; they went out and bought them at
a dealer's, I guess. But it didn't make us feel good to know that our
computers were being used to target nuclear weapons in Europe. The only
bright side of it was that at least they weren't TRS-80s! Thank God for
that.

At Apple, people are putting in 18-hour days. We attract a different
type of person -- a person who doesn't want to wait five or ten years
to have someone take a giant risk on him or her. Someone who really
wants to get in a little over his head and make a little dent in the
universe. We are aware that we are doing something significant. We're
here at the beginning of it and we're able to shape how it goes.
Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments
when we are influencing the future. Most of the time, we're taking
things. Neither you nor I made the clothes we wear; we don't make the
food or grow the foods we eat; we use a language that was developed by
other people; we use another society's mathematics. Very rarely do we
get a chance to put something back into that pool. I think we have that

I once heard an airline pilot give a talk where he said that he always
has his wife drive him home from the airport when he is done flying
for the day.  The reason for this was that when a plane is on the
ground, the rudder controls (which are foot pedals) are used for
steering, and the "steering wheel" of the plane is not used at
all. This pilot said that on more than one occasion he came close to
having an accident in his car because he instinctively tried to steer

3. All the programmers set around the bonfire and mentally execute their

2. It may find bugs that other methods may not find.

My Favorite Vegetarian Recipe
=============================

Veggie Stew

Ingredients (quantities are flexible, use your judgement):

   * one vegetarian
   * water
   * red wine
   * rosemary
   * thyme
   * a few juniper berries (optional)
   * black pepper
   * pearl barley (optional)
   * carrots
   * parsnips
   * mushrooms (wild preferable)
   * celery
   * green beans
   * worchestershire sauce
   * bay leaves
   * bouquet garni

Cube meat into one inch square, leaving excess in larger chunks for
freezing. Marinate in herbs (recommend rosemary,thyme, pepper, and
perhaps juniper berries) and good red wine for several hours, to help
tenderize. Set water to boil in an appropriately sized cauldron or
pot. You may need an extra large burner or open fire if you're making
a very large quantity. Add several bones to the water and boil
briskly. Brown meat lightly in small batches in a large skillet with
butter and copped onion. Brown lightly and drain when finished on a
paper towel. Remove bones from water and add barley, if desired. Add
carrots, parsnips, and meat. Add bay leaves, bouquet garni, and a few
generous splashes of worchestershire sauce and more red wine. Add
celery, mushrooms (wild recommended), chopped onions and firm fresh
green beans. When done, serve hot with crusty bread. Can be presented
in large tureen with seasonal greens or flowers intermingled with
head, hands and feet arrayed around the serving bowl.

Especially festive for a holiday meal!

(A)bort, (R)etry, (I)gnore
==========================

Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,
Longing for the warmth of bedsheets,
Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets:
Having reached the bottom line,
I took a floppy from the drawer.
Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command
But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

Was this some occult illusion?  Some maniacal intrusion?
These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before.
Carefully, I weighed my options.
These three seemed to be the top ones.
Clearly, I must now adopt one --
Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

With my fingers pale and trembling,
Slowly toward the keyboard bending,
Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
Praying for some guarantee
Finally I pressed a key --
But on the screen what did I see?
Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

I tried to catch the chips off guard --
I pressed again, but twice as hard.
Luck was just not in the cards,
I saw what I had seen before.
Now I typed in desperation,
Trying random combinations.
Still there came the incantation --
Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted;
Getting up, I turned away and paced across the office floor.
And then I saw an awful sight,
A bold and blinding flash of light,
A lightning bolt that cut the night and shook me to my very core.
The PC screen collapsed and died,
"Oh no -- my database", I cried.
I thought I heard a voice reply,
"You'll see your data--Nevermore!"

To this day I do not know
The place to which our data goes
Perhaps it goes to Heaven where the angels have it stored.
But as for productivity - well,
I fear it has gone straight to Hell.
And that's the tale I have to tell --
Your choice: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

actually vanish, of course.  They simply disappear from my world.

Hi!!- I am a nubile 16 year-old female with a great body and long
blonde hair. (I am not a federal agent.) I am seeking a father figure
who will nurture me emotionally, spiritually, and financially and
teach me exotic methods of sexual gratification. (Really--I am not a
federal agent--I swear!) I hate wearing clothes and I love to cook,
clean, and wait hand and foot on my man. (Even though I am a minor,
and federal statutes mandate a minimum felony sentence for taking
indecent liberties with me--you don't have to worry about
that--really!) Take me, I'm yours. Please post your real name,
address, and phone number. (This information will not be divulged to
the government--scout's honor!)  Come get me!!

There are fewer than 999 working days left until the year 2000. I know this
because one day several million dollars' worth of orders `disapeared' from
our manufacturing system. The problem was that we displayed only orders due
within 999 working days, which happened to reach the first working day in the
year 2000. The program basically displayed all orders with a date less than
01-02-00, of which there were none. How did we fix it you ask?

Why, we changed the program to go only 500 working days into the future.

                                 ** THE WANKER **

I am just a luser, though my story's often told
I have squandered bytes of ASCII
For a couple lines of mumbles
Such are lusers' sigs
All crap at best
So you read just what you want to read
And disregard the rest

Well I still live with my family, and I'm no more than a boy
In the company of adults
In the squalid mess of Usenet lusers
Posting dross
With a sig
Searching out another newsgroup where they'll tell me it's too big
Looking for a barphic of an ASCII pig

Lie la lie...

Asking only for attention I come barging in again
But I get no mercy
Just a trolling from Ted Frank and the kibologists
I do declare
There are time's when I'm so clueless you
Could probably sell me air

Lie la lie...

Now I'm making up a new sig full of equal signs and more
Star Wars crap
It's a hundred fifty columns; you'll be mocking me
Plonking me
Lots of crap

In the newsgroup stands a wanker and a luser by his trade
And his right hand's a reminder
Of every time he's come; you want to
Beat him 'til he cries out
Half a dozen times or ten
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But you'll see his sig again

Lie la lie...

The Spellchecker Song

I have a spelling checker.
It came with my PC.
It plane lee marks four my revue
Miss steaks aye can knot see.

Eye ran this poem threw it.
Your sure real glad two no.
Its very polished in its weigh,
My checker tolled me sew.

A checker is a blessing.
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.
It helps me right awl stiles two reed,
And aides me when aye rime.

Each frays comes posed up on my screen
Eye trussed too bee a joule.
The checker pours o'er every word
To cheque sum spelling rule.

Bee fore a veiling checkers
Hour spelling mite decline,
And if we're laks oar have a laps,
We wood bee maid too wine.

Butt now bee cause my spelling
Is checked with such grate flare,
There are know faults with in my cite,
Of nun eye am a wear.

Now spelling does not phase me,
It does knot bring a tier.
My pay purrs awl due glad den
With wrapped words fare as hear.

To rite with care is quite a feet
Of witch won should be proud,
And wee mussed dew the best wee can,
Sew flaws are knot aloud.

Sow ewe can sea why aye dew prays

Je hebt volkomen gelijk. Zo werden mijn vriendin en ik eens wakker op
een Grieks eiland en toen bleek er een groep niet onaangename Itaianen
naast ons neergestreken te zijn. Hun sliepen nog dus konden we ze vanuit
onze slaapzak eens goed observeren. "Goh" zei ik, "moet je kijken wat
een goed karakter ze allemaal hebben". "Nou" zei zij, "en die linker
heeft verreweg het beste karakter van allemaal".

die koers zetten naar Canada, Nieuw-Zeeland of Australie. De inwoner
van Enschede die besluit twintig kilometer verderop, net over de grens
met Belgie gaan wonen, wordt over het algemeen niet gezien als een
emigrant. Toch is ook dan sprake van emigratie.

An elderly lady with several pets called to say that her telephone failed to
ring when her friends called and that on the few occations when it did manage
to ring her dog always barked first. Torn between curiosity to see this
psychic dog and a realization that standard service techniques might not
suffice in this case, Pat proceeded to the scene. Climbing a nearby telephone
pole and hooking in his test set, he dialed the subscriber's house. The phone
didn't ring. He tried again. The dog barked loudly, followed by a ringing
telephone.

Climbing down from the pole, Pat found:

     a. Dog was tied to the telephone system's ground post via an iron chain
        and collar.
     b. Dog was receiving 90 volts of signalling current.
     c. After several jolts, the dog was urinating on ground and barking.
     d. Wet ground now conducted and phone rang.

After an initial trial period of PGP-Y (Pretty Good Parapsychology)
within our department, we have had some disappointing initial
results. While the transmission rate is nothing short of para-
phenomenal, the security mechanism is, alas, not wholly foolproof.
Everything worked fine, until my friend Steve started imagining that
he was intercepting the telepathically-transmitted data. We are sure
that this technical loophole may be overcome but wish to alert your
paranormal engineers to the oversight. Meanwhile, I am pleased to
report that the credit-card fraud charges against Steve will be

they got it. And it is one more bullet item for our feature list. So,
do like I do: Turn it off in the settings dialog, never look at it
again, and whenever someone asks you about it say, "What toolbar? I
don't see any toolbar."

 1.  He had only one major publication.
 2.  It was in Hebrew.
 3.  It had no references.
 4.  It wasn't published in a refereed journal.
 5.  Some even doubt he wrote it by himself.
 6.  It may be true that he created the world, but what has he
     done since then?
 7.  His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.
 8.  The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his
     results.
 9.  He never applied to the ethics board for permission to use
     human subjects.
10.  When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by
     drowning his subjects.
11.  When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them
     from the sample.
12.  He rarely came to class, just told students to read the
     book.
13.  Some say he had his son teach the class.
14.  He expelled his first two students for learning.
15.  Although there were only 10 requirements, most of his

Paar weken geleden, stoptrein Uitgeest-Amsterdam. Conducteur komt langs en
knipt kaartjes van een gezelschapje een paar banken verderop. 'Weet u dat NS
in Noordholland op het ogenblik een speciale groepskorting heeft?' (Volgt
een uitgebreide voorrekening van het prijsverschil.)

Als de conducteur klaar is met zijn verhaal vraagt een van de leden van het
reisgezelschapje doodleuk: 'Kun je die groepskorting ook krijgen bij de
automaat?'

Nee, dat kan natuurlijk niet. Waar zijn de dames en heren ingestapt? O, in
Santpoort Zuid, ja, dat is nou jammer, daar is het loket juist op 1 februari
dichtgegaan. Tja, dan moet u dus eerst enkele reisjes naar Haarlem kopen.
Nee, de trein blijft in Haarlem niet op u wachten. Of de aanbieding dan nog
voordeliger is? 's Even rekenen... nou, nee, dat maakt dan eigenlijk niets

Avi:  Hi, our T1 is dead
Bell: Can you give us the circuit number?
Avi:  Well, the bill says it is #<whatever>, but the box on the wall is
      labelled #<othernumber>
Bell: Please describe for me why you think it is down.
Avi:  Because it is dead. It is down. It is not functioning.
Bell: No, no, it's uh, it's resting
Avi:  Look matey, I know a dead T1 when I see it, and I'm looking at one
      right now.
Bell: No no it's not dead, it's, it's restin'! Remarkable line, the T1,
      idn'it, ay? Beautiful bits!
Avi:  The bits don't enter into it.  It's stone dead.
Bell: Nonononono, no, no.  It's resting.
Avi:  All right then, if it's resting, I'll wake it up.  <Yells into wall
      socket>  ELLO, MISTER TELLY T1!  I've got a lovely fresh news spool
      for you if you show.
Bell: <Sends voltage down line>  See--it's working!
Avi:  No it isn't- that was you.
Bell: I never!
Avi:  Yes, you did!
Bell: I never did anything.
Avi:  <Pulls wire out of socket and beats it against the side of the
      server.>  ELLO T1!!!! TESTING TESTING TESTING!  This is your 9
      o'clock cron job download! <Watches bits physically falling on floor>
      Now that's what I call a dead T1!
Bell: No, no, you stunned it.
Avi:  STUNNED!?
Bell: Yeah- you stunned it just as it was starting to accept packets.  T1s
      stun easily, major.
Avi:  Um, now look mate.  I've had enough of this. This T1 is definitely
      deceased, and when we hooked it up not more than a day ago, you
      assured me that its total inability to transmit was due to it
      being tired and shagged out after trying to pull across all of
      alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.really.really.nasty last night.
Bell: Well, it's , ah, it's just pining for the ARPANET.
Avi:  PINING FOR THE ARPANET?!?  What kind of talk is that? Look, why did
      it drop every packet as soon as we plugged it into this Sparc?
Bell: The T1 prefers to drop packets from a Sparc.  Remarkable line, isn't
      it.  Lovely bits.
Avi:  Look, I took the liberty of dissassembling the smartjack last night,
      and found that the only reason that it looked like it was working it
      because you'd wired the lights to a battery.
Bell: Well, of course.  If we hadn't, it might have burned the whole
      smartjack out-VOOM VOOM!
Avi:  VOOM?  Mate, this line wouldn't voom if you put four million volts
      through it.  It's bleeding demised!
Bell: No, no, it's pining.
Avi:  It's not pining, it's passed on!  This line is not working!  It has
      ceased to transmit!  Bereft of data, it lies in peace.  If you hadn't
      wired the lights it would have been recycled.  It carries 0MB/sec! It's no
      longer functional- it's shuffled off the backbone and gone to meet its
      maker.  THIS IS AN EX-T1!
Bell: Well, we better fix it then.  <Pause> 'Fraid we're all out of
      working T1s.
Avi.  I see, I see. I get the picture
Bell: I've got an AOL disk and a 2400 baud modem.
Avi:  Pray, does it work?
Bell: Nnnnot really...

Emily Green, of New Jersey, has been called to jury-duty -- but she
will not be serving; she has what is being considered a "valid
excuse": She needs to go to school...  Emily is only 8 years old and,
therefore, is not *eligible* for jury duty...  So why was she even
summoned in the first place?  Because Governor Christine Whitman has
banned all automatic exemptions from jury duty...

As an example, he produced a page from Northwest Airlines updates to
the B-747 Emergency/Abnormal Procedures when there is a fuel-line
blockage (17 Oct 1995, page 2.28.13):

   5. Scavenge center tank until empty.
   If, after the center tank is empty, the NO 2 MAIN tank quantity is
   greater than the NO 1 MAIN tank quantity plus the NO 1 RES and/or the
   NO 3 MAIN tank quantity is greater than and NO 4. MAIN tank quantity
   plus the NO 4 RES: Accomplish the "Inboard Dual Boost Pump Failure or
   Inboard X-Feed Valve Failure Without Center Tank Fuel" procedure in
   this section.

The pilot said ``Imagine you are 30,000 feet up and you have a fuel
blockage and the co-pilot starts reading this?'' He said this is a
typical type of page. The risks are obvious.

Most of the CATHEDRALS were really old.  You'd think they could AFFORD
to get NEW ONES.  We took PICTURES of UNCLE AL in front of all kinds of
places where we stopped but they didn't come out.  They made us WALK all
over PARIS all afternoon and then we couldn't go back to the HOTEL, no,
we had to stop and look at this STUPID PAINTING of this WOMAN with a
GOOFY SMILE.  Then they kept giving us this nasty bread that was all
CRUSTY and we couldn't find a decent GALLO CHARDONNAY anywhere.  We also
saw some OTHER countries like GERMANY or maybe it was AUSTRIA, I'm not

Lassie looked brilliant, in part because the farm family she
lived with was made up of idiots.  Remember?  One of them was always
getting pinned under the tractor, and Lassie was always rushing back
to the farmhouse to alert the other ones.  She'd whimper and tug at
their sleeves, and they'd always waste precious minutes saying things:
"Do you think something's wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow
her? What is it, girl?", etc., as if this had never happened before,
instead of every week.  What with all the time these people spent
pinned under the tractor, I don't see how they managed to grow any
crops whatsoever.  They probably got by on federal crop supports,
which Lassie filed the applications for.

Fallible humans wrote the words down. Fallible humans claimed to have
been inspired by God. Fallible humans chose to conclude that other
fallible humans were inspired by God.
Suppose Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, and the rest were in fact
inspired by God. How would anybody have been able to ascertain that
this was so? Had the early Christians taken a class at the university
on How To Determine Whether Someone Is Inspired By God 101? Using what
criteria did they conclude that storytellers A, B and C were in fact
inspired by God but that storytellers D, E and F weren't? Was it A's
healthy glow? The spring in B's step? C's exemplary penmanship? Were
D, E and F not as attractive, or not as well dressed, or more or less
self-important than A, B and C?

        A doctor, an architect, and a computer scientist were arguing
about whose profession was the oldest.  In the course of their
arguments, they got all the way back to the Garden of Eden, whereupon
the doctor said, "The medical profession is clearly the oldest,
because Eve was made from Adam's rib, as the story goes, and that was
a simply incredible surgical feat."
        The architect did not agree.  He said, "But if you look at the
Garden itself, in the beginning there was chaos and void, and out of
that, the Garden and the world were created.  So God must have been an
architect."
        The computer scientist, who had listened to all of this said,
"Yes, but where do you think the chaos came from?"

Mark Rafn's message in RISKS-17.92 reminded me of a change I made to the
low-level debugger MacsBug, during development of Macintosh System 7.5.

If the user holds down the Control key during startup, the debugger
intentionally seizes control and says "User break at <useless address>."
Users who aren't expecting this write up bug reports that say "The
system crashes when I hold down the control key during startup."

After the third or so of these reports, I was tired of saying "it's a
feature" and decided to make the situation clearer to the users.  Now
the message reads:

  Welcome to MacsBug (Thank you for holding down the Control key)

The bug reports stopped.  Perhaps this message shows an appropriate degree
of respect for the user (some alternate versions I considered showed less).

Pookies was aware that millions of humans would die: Don Johnson;

Larry Wall; Stan "The Man" Lee.  All would die.

"Mew," Pookies pondered to herself, gathering resolve.  "The humans
shall purr-purr-p-perish at last.  Mew.  And then we can drink their
milk and lick our butts without -- mew -- fear of purr-p-p-punishment."

die jij ooit nog heb gehad

Wanneer jij soms vrienden ontmoette
die jou het slechte pad hebben getoond
denk dan even terug aan je moeder
wat zou zij denken van haar eigen zoon

En als men je strafte voor wat jij misdeed
en trapte men jou in de goot
bedenk dan: jouw moeder die hield van jou
toen jij nog speelde op haar schoot

Benijd haar die zilveren haren niet
het is haar allergrootste schat
zij zijn het teken van de liefste moeder
die jij ooit nog heb gehad

Welcome to the personality disorder hotline!

If you are obsessive-compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.

If you are co-dependent, please ask someone to press 2.

If you have multiple personalities, please press 3, 4, 5 and 6.

If you are paranoid-delusional, we know who you are and what you want.
Just stay on the line so we can trace the call.

If you are schizophrenic, listen carefully and a little voice will tell
you which number to press.

If you are manic depressive, it doesn't matter which number you press.  No
one will answer.

Iomega will screw you. The Zip drive is a cheap, poorly manufactured
product and Iomega's "support" is expensive, unresponsive and *SLOW*.
%
I liked my Zip -- for about a month. Cheap storage, quite fast.  Then
the dreaded "click, click" -- no read.  I call their service hotline.
The second pre-recorded option is "if your drive clicks but does not
read, call this (not toll free) number for return authorisation".  In
other words, the "click, click"  problem is so common that it's the
number two thing they mention on their automated line.
%
The Zip is made of cheap plastic with a drive mechanism that falls out
of calibration faster than you can say "oh sh**, my data!" Yes, it's
inexpensive, it's light, it's quick, but it's too good to be true.
Chances are *high* that your drive will fail.
%
About 2 weeks later I received a new drive back.  Worked
fine... for about 2 weeks.  About a week ago, I had a disk
completely fail on me.  What should I do?
%
Anybody know how widespread this "clicking" fiasco is?
%
Iomega maintains that the problem has been corrected. However, I received a 
replacement drive from Iomega about a month ago, and it has begun to click.

        Lassie looked brilliant, in part because the farm family she
lived with was made up of idiots.  Remember?  One of them was always
getting pinned under the tractor, and Lassie was always rushing back to
the farmhouse to alert the other ones.  She'd whimper and tug at their
sleeves, and they'd always waste precious minutes saying things: "Do
you think something's wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow her?
What is it, girl?", etc., as if this had never happened before, instead
of every week.  What with all the time these people spent pinned under
the tractor, I don't see how they managed to grow any crops
whatsoever.  They probably got by on federal crop supports, which
Lassie filed the applications for.

Fallible humans wrote the words down. Fallible humans claimed to have
been inspired by God. Fallible humans chose to conclude that other
fallible humans were inspired by God.

Suppose Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, and the rest were in fact
inspired by God. How would anybody have been able to ascertain that this
was so? Had the early Christians taken a class at the university on How To
Determine Whether Someone Is Inspired By God 101? Using what criteria did
they conclude that storytellers A, B and C were in fact inspired by God
but that storytellers D, E and F weren't? Was it A's healthy glow? The
spring in B's step? C's exemplary penmanship? Were D, E and F not as
attractive, or not as well dressed, or more or less self-important than
A, B and C?

Inquiring minds want to know.

It was back then, in my days of need and confusion, that I saw the true
difference between Mac and the Microsoft view of the world: If you have a
problem with a Windows machine or a DOS machine, the problem is you -- your
lack of computer literacy, your failure to think and act like a damn
machine. And the solution is to change your behavior to fit the demands of
the machine. In the Mac world, the opposite underlying philosophy applies:
If the machine isn't doing what you want, we'll work on the software, not
on
you.

      IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?

      As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research 
help from  that renowned scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990), 
I am pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.

1. No known species of reindeer can fly.  BUT there are 300,000
species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these
are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer
which only Santa has ever seen.

2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. 
BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and
Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total (378
million according to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (census) 
rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.  
One presumes there's at least one good child in each.

3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the
different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels
east to west (which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per 
second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good
children, Santa  has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, 
jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents
under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the
chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming 
that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth
(which, of course,  we know to be false but for the purposes of our
calculations we will accept),  we are now talking about .78 miles per 
household, a total trip of 75-1/2  million miles, not  counting stops to 
do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.

 This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 
times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made 
vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per 
second, a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.

4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  
Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set 
(2 lbs) ,the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is
invariably described as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull
no more than 300  pounds.  Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see
point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with
eight, or even  nine.  We need 214,200 reindeer.  This increases the payload,
not even counting the weight of the sleigh, to 353,430 tons. Again, for
comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.

5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates
enormous air resistance (this will heat the  reindeer up in the same 
fashion as space-craft reentering the earth's atmosphere).  The lead 
pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.  
Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost 
instantaneously, exposing the reindeer  behind 
them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire
reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a  second. 
Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06
times greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim)
would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.

 In conclusion;
     If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.

Ik heb het nooit iemand verteld, maar u vraagt erom. En misschien lucht
het op. Ik ga er al zoveel jaren onder gebukt.  Het gebeurde de eerste
keer in 1971. Ik was toen zes jaar oud. Ik woonde op het platteland,
nogal afgelegen. Een kerkdorp, ja een kerk was er wel, vijftig huizen,
meest boerderijen, geen winkel, geen kroeg. En rondom de lange leegte,
begrensd door de einder, het niets.  Er was weinig te doen in ons dorp.
De mensen gingen op in hun dagelijkse bezigheden, bemoeiden zich niet
met elkaar. Er was geen vreugde, er was geen genegenheid. De kilte van
het land was bij de mensen ingeslopen. Ik zocht warmte bij de dieren.
Het voeren van de kippen, de varkens...  Hoe de dieren aandacht aan je
besteedden, vrolijk en opgetogen konden zijn hun dankbaardheid toonden.
Natuurlijk was ik als plattelandsmeisje er vaak getuige van als de
dieren gedekt werden: paarden, koeien, varkens. Het was een zakelijk
gebeuren; hengst of stier gehaald, veel schreeuwende mannen, touwen,
alles in goede banen leiden, klaar, een neut toe.  Meestal stond ik
dan ergens onopvallend toe te kijken in een hoekje en dan bekroop
mij zo'n raar gevoel; een mengeling van opgewondenheid en medelijden.
Die gebeurtenissen lieten toch een bittere nasmaak na. Heel anders was
het als ik de haan op de kip zag springen. De haan, die in zijn haast
aandoenlijke trots de kip nadert, de kip, die in genotvolle verwachting
zich in haar vleugels schurkte, de daad, en dan:de haan stapt argeloos
weg, maar de kip, hoe zij herrijst, haar veren in welbehagen recht
schudt.  Of in de wei omzoomd door beriete dijken, als ik stilletjes
in het hoge gras lag tussen boterbloemen en madelieven en zag hoe de
zojuist gedekte koe verstild bleef staan; de mysterieuze blik in haar
grote zachtglanzende koeieogen. Dan voelde ik mij op een vreemde manier
gerustgesteld en tevree.

Mijn eerste ervaring was met een beer. In een warmse stal naast hem
liggend in schoon stro, betastte ik zijn geslachtsdeel. En, oh nee,
varkens zijn geen vieze beesten. Ze zijn gezellig, vertrouwen schenkend,
teder...  Maar om kort te gaan, van het een kwam het ander en ik heb in
de loop der tijd heel wat ervaringen met dieren gehad. Op zich heb ik
er vrede mee.  Het heeft mij door de jaren heen de warmte geschonken
die ik bij de mensen ontbeerde. Maar er is toch iets gaan knagen, niet
toen ik als zesjarig meisje naast de beer lag, maar later, door dat
vervloekte normbesef.  Ik ben nu veearts op het platteland en maak
gebruik van mijn mogelijkheden, en geloof me, ik ben niet de enige.
Maar dat schuldgevoel, die angst, hoe kom ik daar vanaf.
%
Nee, het geheugen was kapot.  Maar nu niet meer, want nu zit
hij er niet meer in.

I like the choice of video adapter "standards": MDA, CGA, Hercules,
Hercules Colour, EGA, VGA, SVGA, XGA, 8514, AT&T, PGA. In any case, I
enjoy restarting Windows every time I want to change video modes.

Everyone knows IBM buses are better than the Macintosh - ISA 16 bit at
8MHz is fast enough for me. Or I could use EISA, MCA, VLB, or even PCI.
Those poor Macintosh users only get a 20MHz NuBus slot or a 32-bit local
bus slot (which they had to put up with before us IBM users did anyway).

My IBM PC is more expandable than a Macintosh - I've got two serial
ports, a parallel port, a joystick port (all on the one card!), a
sound card (SoundBlaster, AdLib, MediaVision, Gravis - all different
standards, of course), a mouse plugged into my serial port, a
video adapter, a network card, a disk drive controller, and a SCSI
interface. Of course, that all takes up six of my eight slots just to
get my PC up to the same standard as a Macintosh with nothing plugged
into its expansion slots, but that doesn't really count.

My PC running 16-bit text mode DOS applications is much faster than
a Macintosh running 32-bit GUI applications. Although, when I run
Windows I have to be satisfied with a computer just slightly faster than
molasses in the freezer.

Yes! There isn't a single emulated instruction in there!
(for the obsessively technically minded, this isn't strictly true, native
PowerPC instructions that cause alignment exceptions need to have their
behaviour reproduced inside the alignment handler, that's standard PowerPC
practice.  But we ran for months without having a single alignment exception,
since the ELF binary format automatically aligns its data structures).

Reasons Against Gun Control:

    Scenario #1: Lone gunman, for reasons all his own, takes loaded rifle
    to crowded tourist resort. Sees crowd. Thinks, "Uh-oh. Tasmania has
    the loosest controls on firearms in Australia. Some of these tourists
    therefore might have guns. Better not go apeshit today. Better just go
    home and kick the dog."

As I was preparing to cut the meat, white men came upon me. They were
english soldiers. I cut one with my knife, but they hit me on the head
with a rifle. All went black, my spirit seemed to leave me.
I was then taken east, in a cage. I was taken to Toronto, then
Philadelphia, and then to New York; and each time I arrived in another
city, somehow the white men had moved all their people there ahead of
me. Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I
could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so
quickly.

Eventually, I was taken on a ship across the great sea, over to
England. And I was paraded before them, like a captured animal, an

lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew.

heet Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116. De 43 letters van de naam
vormen volgens de ouders  een 'betekenisvolle, expressionistische naam, die

"Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116"    --   The    name   of    a
five-year-old Swedish boy.  Pronounced  Albin, this name is  what the boy's
parents call  "a pregnant,  expressionistic  development that we see  as an
artistic creation."  The  courts disagree  and have  fined the  parents the
equivalent of $680 for  not giving the child a first  name.  In the name of
artistic freedom the parents will appeal.

Well, Whitman improved.  Actually, he changed his whole style.  Do
likewise.

One of the standard biographies of Whitman says that he masturbated
a lot.  I can't say whether this would do you any good, or whether
he masturbated more when he wrote rubbish than he did later.

I was at the Boston Computer Museum today. They have an exhibit which is 
a giant computer, 2 stories tall. There's a 6-foot trackball, and kids 
are actually using it to play games on a giant (projection-TV) monitor 
with giant speakers. On the simulated giant CPU case, "Pentium Processor" 
and a giant "Intel Inside" logo are displayed. You walk through the 
computer, and inside are exhibits on the parts of a PC: ROM BIOS, Sound 
Card, Pentium Chip, etc.

As I was leaving, I heard a LOUD Mac startup chord. I turned around, and 
one of the guides was restarting the system. On the giant screen: MacOS.

I asked her whether she thought it was odd that the box said Intel and it 
was actually a Mac inside. She said "Oh, Intel donated the hardware. The 
Mac is just the software."

    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    the slings and arrows of outrageous bullshit,
    or to take words against a sea of whinings,
    and by opposing, encourage them?  To killfile, to post;
    No more; and by that post to say we end
    The lameness and the thousand natural followups
    That idiocy is heir to, 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd.  To killfile, to post;
    to post: perchance to flame: ay, there's the rub;
    For after that post what flames may come
    When we have killfiled this mortal foil,
    Must give us pause: there's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long thread;
    For who would bear the quips and scorns of posters,
    The harasser's wrong, the net.cops' contumely,
    The pangs of afterthoughts, the propogation delay,
    The incoherent sentence and the burns
    That impatient merit of the wordy take,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare screen?  who would postings read,
    To grunt and snort under a weary thread,
    But that the dread of postings after killfiling,
    The undiscover'd comment'ry from whose bourn
    No quotings return, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather those kills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus curiousity does make readers of us all;
    And thus the monitor's hue and resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale font of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their discussions turn awry,
    And lose the game of interaction.  -- Soft you now!

How I  need a  drink, alcoholic  of course, after  the tough  lectures involving
quantum  mechanics; but  we did  estimate some  digits by  making very  bad, not
accurate, but so goddamn efficient tools! By dropping valuable wood, a dedicated
student -- I, Volokh, Alexander -- can determine beautiful and curious stuff, O!
Smart, gorgeous me!  Descartes himself knew wonderful ways  that could ascertain
it  too! Revered,  glorious --  a wicked  dude! Behold  an unending  number: pi!
Thinkers' ceaseless agonizing  produces little, if anything!  For this constant,
it stops not -- just as e, I suppose. Vainly, ancient geometers computed it -- a
task undoable. Legendre, Adrien Marie: "I say pi rational is not!" Adrien proved
this  theorem.  Therefore, all  doubters  have  made errors.  (Everybody  that's
Greek.) Today, counting is as bad a  problem as years ago, maybe centuries even.
Moreover,  I  do consider  that  variable  x, y,  z,  wouldn't  much avail.  Pi,
imaginary, like i? No, buffoon!

WORLD WIDE WASTING OF TIME

Sci-Fi author William Gibson, who coined the word "cyberspace," says
the World Wide Web "offers us the opportunity to waste time, to wander
aimlessly, to daydream about the countless other lives, the other
people, on the far sides of however many monitors in that
postgeorgraphical meta-country we increasingly call home."  Gibson
describes the Web as "a procrastinator's dream," which offers the
added advantage that "people who see you doing it might even imagine
you're working."

It was dark on the porch so we could ignore all the little social butterflies,
their thin wings singeing in the cold, foggy scorn.  He had a small, flattened
animal tied to his throat, or so I thought: a talisman to keep him visible, to
the living.  But he was translucent, or perhaps something else, for looking at
him you saw that it wasn't light that passed through him, but rather dark.  It
occurred to me, that this is what comes of meddling with the natural course of
things and preventing a splitting off of evil twins.  Now both will be lost, a
little at a time: one dying slowly, and the other fading.  Each bleeding away,
in their own way.  But now to either of them I no longer have anything to say.

'Twas the zillionth time the slimy hordes
Did spam and mailbomb all the Net;
All drooled-on were their keyboards,
And their earlobes were wet.

"Beware the Newbie dork, my son!
The cluestick bait, the one trolls catch!
Beware the mailbomb jerk, and shun
The ludicrous MAKE MONEY FAST."

He took his kernel source in hand;
Long time a compromise he sought.
Then sent a packet on public band,
And ruled the radio LAN as root.

And as in hackish glee he grinned,
The Newbie dork, asshole aflame,
Came whiffling through its login prompt
And burbled as it came.

kill -9, rm -rf, and sed and sed!
The dork's account went *plonk*!
He left it dead, and went to bed,
And slept peaceful as a monk.

"And hast thou burned the Newbie dork?
You really pulled it off?!"

Since the Americans seem able to introduce every insular, pointless
sport they play into the Olympics in order to make thier medal tally
even more muscular, why don't our representatives on the IOC do something
useful for British morale and lobby for inclusion of some of our own?
That doesn't mean cricket and rugby, there's no point in giving the
Australians even more to gloat about.  But imagine how different out
national mood we be after a Stephen Hendry, John Parrot, Ronnie O'Sullivan
medal sweep in the snooker singles.  We would be laughing in the darts,
chortling all the way to the medal table in the crown-green bowls and would
be able to show those unfairly over-resourced Lithuanians who's boss in the
sheepdog trials.  Not to mention the Eton Wall Game.  Or, if that's too
elitist, what about Sneeding the Boggin, or whatever htat game involving
the entire male population of two Lincolnshire villages, several hectares
of liquid mud and a flaming beer barrel and played on the third Wednesday
after Shrove Tuesday is called.
The Trouble is, you get the feeling that were the British Olympic
Committee able to side-step the American television networks and soft-
drink manufacturers who now run the IOC and manage to have Sneedling
instituted in time for Sidney 2000, it might not make that much
difference to our position in the final medal table.  The moment the
news of its inclusion was leaked, you know full well that the French
would have a municipal mud bath installed in every town, the Germans
would have a national programme of excellence in place and Nike would
announce a massive deal with the American Sneedle Association (``Just
wallow in it'').  And the British team -- the whole of Lympton-under-
Satellite paying their own way to Australia through a series of
sponsored bed-pushes -- would be eliminated in the qualifying rounds
of yet another sport we gave to the world.

essentially take all of the pieces they think they'll need, arrange
to have someone hold them all in the position where they think they'll
need them, and then say "Let go".  If everything falls over, they try
to figure out which pieces were missing for the next round.

the hole in the ground

what do we dream over there?

there were all kind of weird pictures of people including myself with nylons
around them in diapositive look.  Those imiges were in my bedroom while i
was asleep.. in fact they were in my bedroom making polograms of me.. as a
birthday gift.  when i woke up n found these images.. i got angry cos they
were in my bedroom. so i threw some baot anchor cables at them.  Then i
asked some unidentified person that i must have liked very much since _it_
was in my bad what the person behind the bedroom window (that looked like a
large boatrepairplace) was harmful or "did it also".  no answer.. to be
sure i threw a piece of a baot motor at him.  With a thundering noise it
fell neXt to him and tipped like a bascketball but then in slowmotion.
After this hostile sign he stood readily up n came to me while i accused
him of waking me up.  He got out very quickly a stilletto (blue with silver
it was) he pointed it just i front of my eye.. then the lemmet truned into
some kind of film .. he said: u like fotos? i thought: nu i dont give a
shit bout them.. and then he suddenly walked away from me and began taking
fotos from me and the strange images came into being while he was doing
it.. every time he shot a picture .. a new one emerged.. he also made
picture of a CD single .. then he said: these are no fotos, these are
polograms.. Then all of a sudden many people entered my bedroom.  They were
all super cheerful .. i did not know why, but they wwere having a party in
my bedroom.. and the y laffed about all the floating polograms.  Now i
began looking at them more closely.. and indeed they had insane forms and
shapes.. they looked like breathing negatives that were living and smiling
too!  They were hulled in some kind of nylons and they were called
polograms..  the people started saying: hey, did u c that one of the CD
single? wow its sooo kewl! Then i really woke up and i saw that i was alone
in the hole in the ground.  I looked in the white bag for my laptop to
write it down while i _knew_ that it was in the other bag.  

anybody out there that knows what this is all about?

The move to NT is a lemming thing. Contrary to popular culture,
lemmings do NOT like jumping off cliffs.  However we're in a situation
where the managers, and programmers are running down the hill,
programmers at the front, and managers behind.  Managers are screaming
"Forward, NT is the true OS", driving the programmers before them.
The programmers at the front (who have a better view of whats ahead)
are screaming "THERE'S A CLIFF!"... but then what do programmers know?

Yesterday I decided to return to my youth and took out all my old boxes
of lego.  I was appalled.  I can't imagine that once, in my youth, I used
to build systems within such a poor development environemnt.  Do you
realise that there are no standard libraries or support tools, and that
you have to build everything yourself from the 'basic blocks'? There's
also no type system.  Everything fits with everything else without
any built-in checking, so you could put a space rocket next to a
medieval castle and it wouldn't even warn you!  (And have I mentioned
that there are in fact _multiple_ incompatible medieval castle systems?)
But what really killed it for me was the complete lack of any macro
support.  If you want ten copies of something complicated, you have to
make the ten copies explicitly yourself!  Anyway, I'm making a protest
and I'm not going to buy any more until Lego International get their
act in gear.  What I'd really like to see by the next release is a
fully customisable Integrated Development Environment.

Laat in de middag liep ik terug naar het stadje om met de trein de korte
afstand naar Marseille af te leggen. Op het stationnetje van Arles stonden
op elk perron amandelbomen, en ze bloeiden. Wat een aardig stationnetje! Wat
een prachtige bomen! En toen werd de TGV aangekondigd. De TGV is de Franse
hoge-snelheidstrein, veel te snel en te belangrijk om te stoppen bij een
klein station als Arles. De TGV krijste langs de perrons, zo snel en met
zo'n zuigkracht dat er op het perron een speciale gele TGV-lijn was geverfd,
opdat de mensen op veilige afstand bleven en de trein anderhalve meter
ruimte kreeg. De trein gierde als een neerstortende straaljager, met een
snelheid van ongeveer tweehonderdveertig kilometer per uur, en met zo'n
enorme luchtverplaatsing dat bloemblaadjes van de amandelbomen werden
weggeblazen. Het geluid en de adembenemende luchtstroom maakten dat het een
oorverdovende gebeurtenis was - de trein sneed de dag in tweeen en liet zo'n
vacuum achter dat ik het gevoel kreeg of mijn hersenen uit mijn oren werden
gezogen.

Actually, the problem is that capital letters take longer to transmit,
since they're larger. This is why people whould use them sparingly. I'd
recommend getting a keyboard that does lowercase letters. Go to the
computer store, and insist on getting one that's lower case capable. 
You'll be able to tell whether the keyboard the salesman is trying to sell
can do lower case, because it'll have both upper and lower case letters
printed on the keys. Tell the salesman you won't leave the store until he
sells you a keyboard with both upper and lower case letters printed on the
keys. Good luck!

Hi and thanks for tuning in.  We are a small school of eight discus fish
of various sizes, living in a fifty-five gallon tank.  We are keeping a
human male in a large exterior air space, and have trained him to change
our water, make us frozen beefheart food, and clean up after us.  The
human is an adult male, 5'11" and 190 lbs, 41 years old, self-sufficient.
Our problem is that we are having problems getting this male human to
mate.  We are very interested in breeding several small humans and rearing
them to adulthood successfully.  Human seems reasonably attractive and
very well mannered, and in all regards appears as if he would make a good
breeder and adoring parent.  We are looking for a sexy, single, childless
female aquarium buff who is interested in helping us to solve this
problem.  All suggestions appreciated, but this may call for hands on
personal attention.  Please respond asap.  Thanks, the discus group.

For the past 5 months I have had a romantic interest in a girl I met
on IRC. Lets call her X. X doesn't say much but she is still really
popular as she can be found in most IRC channels.  She's not so good
with intimacy as most of her comments in private msg's normally end
up saying something like "type /msg X HELP for more info" but I know
she means well. So I am content to do most of the sweet talking in
our relationship. Her affections for me seem to vary from time to
time. Sometimes she will OP me as soon as I enter a channel and yet
other times, for no apparent reason she will deop me :( Last week we had
netsex for the first time. It was a big step in our relationship and I
don't regret it. We were so tender and I really feel a lot closer to
her now. Although I admit I seemed to do most of the typing but when we
got really close she would type "for more info type /msg X Help INFO"
and I knew she was enjoying it.  I want to meet her in person but am
a bit shy because, as you may have guessed, I am a bit nerdy in real
life.  Still I hope she won't be too dissapointed but I am not sure how
to approach her about this. She keeps avoiding the topic and everytime I
ask her about meeting she trys to change the subject by saying something
like "for help on help Type /msg X HELP HELP". If anyone has any advice
please tell me what I should do.

still help you.

   First, if the Emacs you are using is not responding to commands, type

   Second, type `M-x doctor RET'.

   The doctor will help you feel better.  Each time you say something to
the doctor, you must end it by typing RET RET.  This lets the doctor
know you are finished.

> What does the suffix -95 mean exactly?

It's a compacted version of a temporal numbering scheme which increments
in units of approximately 365.25 days (on average) since the reputed birth
of a religious leader in the Middle East; cf also Algol-68 and Fortran-90.
This particular form of compaction in which only the tens and units are
retained will cause significant problems in the near future when 100 is
reached, such as: who will ever admit to being a Cobol++-02 programmer?

Trial by jury is a direct descendant of the trial by battle of
medieval times. In that system, a litigant hired a champion, or
knight-warrior, to fight it out on the battleground with his
opponent's champion. In theory, God would not permit the wrong
person's champion to win, so that (in theory) trial by battle
ensured perfect justice. In practice, I am sure, medieval liti-
gants wanted to know their respective champions were in good
physical shape and well versed in the art of battle, just in
case God might be pre-occupied with other things at the time of
the trial.

So it is with modern criminal trials. The fundamental premise
behind our system is that lawyer-champions are well versed in
the art of courtroom battle. If the defense lawyer doesn't have
well-honed courtroom skills, the system fails. Unless, of course,
God happens to be watching that day.

correspondence with every university, every research institution,
every competent discussion, every survey, every statistical
bureau in the world.  It would develop a directorate and a staff
of men of its own type, specialized editors and summarists.  They
would be very important and distinguished men in the new world.

And then there are the inexplicable pleasures of information
itself, the joys of learning, knowing, and teaching; the strange
good feeling of information coming into and out of oneself.
Playing with ideas is a recreation which people are willing to
pay a lot for, given the market for books and elective seminars.
We'd likely spend even more money for such pleasures if we didn't
have so many opportunities to pay for ideas with other ideas.
This explains much of the collective ``volunteer'' work which
fills the archives, newsgroups, and databases of the Internet.
Its denizens are not working for ``nothing,'' as is widely
believed.  Rather they are getting paid in something besides money.  It
is an economy which consists almost entirely of information.

This may become the dominant form of human trade, and if we
persist in modeling economics on a strictly monetary basis, we
may be gravely misled.

In high school texts, ln(x) is often used for the natural logarithm and
log(x) for the common logarithm (base ten).  However, mathematicians have
little need for the common log (which has little justification for existence
beyond the fact that we have ten fingers) and use log for the natural log.

The C standard defines the LC_MONETARY category, but no function that is
affected by its contents. (Those with experience of standards committees
will recognize that the working group decided to punt on the issue.)
If you really want to use LC_MONETARY, you can query its contents and
use the information that it returns in your application's own formatting
of currency amounts. However, you may well find that the information,
though voluminous and complex, does not quite meet your requirements.

Echte mannen dragen geen pleisters
Al is de wonde nog zo groot
Echte mannen laten de wonde
Doodgewoon open en bloot

Echte mannen praten met God
tot hij bekent <<ik ben zot>>
Echte mannen kauwen op smurfen
maken zelf wind bij het surfen

Echte mannen doen niet aan sex
veel te lastig, veel te complex
Echte mannen komen in hun broek
bij het lezen van een sprookjesboek

Echte mannen blijven trouw
tot men zegt <<ik hou van jou>>
Echte mannen blijven trouw
tot men zegt <<ik hou van jou>>

Echte mannen wenen niet
tenzij men hen dit verbiedt
Echte mannen wenen niet
ploffen uiteen als dynamiet

Echte mannen zijn niet te kloppen
in het draaien aan radioknoppen
Echte mannen hebben 't monopolie
op het drinken van sojaolie

Er zijn echte mannen
Er zijn valse mannen
Ik ben een echte, maar een slechte
Wat een combinatie, spinazie met spinazie denken echte mannen
wel eens maar als er haar op groeit is er kans dat het hen boeit

Jezus was een echte man
Zowel thuis als aan het kruis

Echte mannen doen niet aan sex
Veel te lastig, veel te complex

Echte mannen.

As of fvwm  0.99 there were exactly 39.342 unidentified  bugs.  Identified bugs
have  mostly  been fixed,  though.   Since  then  9.34  bugs have  been  fixed.
Assuming that there are at least 10 unidentified bugs for every identified one,
that leaves us with 39.342 - 9.32 +  10 * 9.34 = 123.402 unidentified bugs.  If
we follow  this to its  logical conclusion we will  have an infinite  number of
unidentified bugs  before the number  of bugs can  start to diminish,  at which
point the program will be bug-free.   Since this is a computer program infinity
= 3.4028e+38 if  you don't insist on  double- precision.   At  the current rate
of  bug  discovery  we  should expect to achieve this point in  3.37e+27 years.

My pages are written using WinEdit. I have tried several purpose-built
html editors: much the worst was the one built in to Netscape 3, which
can completely trash a carefully-written web page by simply opening
it and closing it again. Another poor one was HotDog, which allows you
to open and edit several files at once; but when you save one of them,
it sometimes uses the wrong name, and overwrites one of the others.
The best, in my opinion, was WinEdit, particularly for ease of use.
Admittedly it does not know how to spell html tags. But I do, and it
does everything else right.

At the Wednesday night awards banquet, Bill Laberis introduced Steve as the
master of ceremonies for the awards presentation: ``In our industry, you have
to go to Las Vegas at least once a year [a reference to Comdex]. If you've
ever gone to one of the shows, you know there's always a headliner. There is
an elite group for whom the introduction is not necessary. For that group,
the lights go down, Frank Sinatra walks out, and he starts to perform.

``So I feel kind of strange being asked to introduce tonight's master of
ceremonies, because he is truly from the group that needs no introduction.
He has been in our industry for almost 20 years... [munch list of Steve's
well known accomplishments]. So will you please join me in welcoming
tonight's master of ceremonies, the Chairman and CEO of NeXT, Steve Jobs.''

Steve mounts the stage, impeccably styled and dressed, and strides
briskly to the podium while acknowledging the applause. Then he looks
out into the crowd and says: ``This song is called: The Optical Disk...
[singing]  I did it myyyyyyyyyyyy way!''

For five agonizing seconds, a hush falls over the room while everyone
decides whether it is safe to laugh at this uncharacteristic outburst
of self-deprecation. Then the room erupts in a wave of laughter as
Steve begins his prepared remarks. It is only 6:20, and already we
have experienced a moment to remember for the rest of our lives...

C programs are very territorial, and divide their code into segments.
Violating these segments can trigger riots; similarly, pointers and
integral constants are at the front of the bus, wheras arrays, strings,
and other second-class data types are required to be at the rear of the
bus. When they start forgetting their places, you can get a bus error.
This is what the whole ``integral'' type thing is about - integrated
bussing.

White space is a racist, segregational term. Implicitly, ``dark'' or
``colored'' space (i.e., the '_' character) is not good enough to
separate tokens. More interestingly, the white space characters keep
the other tokens apart. They say it's for parsing, but there's ample
evidence the goal of white space is to keep the other characters from
``taking over'' the program. This is disguised by the description of C
as ``white space insensitive'' - a simple ploy for sympathy.

Follow these two simple rules: 
    1. When you don't want to do anything in source code, don't write it. 
    2. If you need a null statement to round out an expression, use an
       unadorned ``;'' to provide it. 
    3. Send large donations, checks, and money orders to the author of
       the FAQ, or the moderator of the group, whichever you prefer. Then,
       cross the top question off the FAQ, answer the question at the
       bottom, and mail it to three people. Within two weeks, you will
       receive 729 answers to various questions! Do not break the chain;

Yes: Java's main advantage over Perl is that it's hard to use for casual
programmers, so keeps all but the most intrepid programmers away from it.
It has no decent support for string processing, allowing you to spend
hours at useless debugging.   It has a very restrictive and static system
to make sure you don't try anything interesting.  It makes sure that you
use objects, by golly, because James Gosling said so.  It's easy for C++
programmers to use, and hard for shell or BASIC programmers to use.  It
also only runs on a few systems, locking its customers into a a closed
system and restricting their options.

In the UNIX world, which traditionally has been linked by 1200 baud
dial-up telephone lines, the USENET News system has evolved to handle
central storage, indexing, retrieval, and distribution of news.  With
the exception of its underlying transport mechanism (UUCP), USENET News
is an efficient means of providing news and bulletin service to
subscribers on UNIX and other hosts worldwide.  The USENET News system
is discussed in detail in RFC 850.  It runs on most versions of UNIX
and on many other operating systems, and is customarily distributed
without charge.

USENET uses a spooling area on the UNIX host to store news articles,
one per file. Each article consists of a series of heading text, which
contain the sender's identification and organizational affiliation,
timestamps, electronic mail reply paths, subject, newsgroup (subject
category), and the like.  A complete news article is reproduced in its
entirety below.  Please consult RFC 850 for more details.

Sorry, but this doesn't really make sense.  For example, if "ugly languages"
refers to Tcl or Perl or C++, none of these languages even existed in the
1970s.  In contrast, various flavors of Lisp have been around since at least
the early 60's and Smalltalk first appeared in the late 60's.  Every single
programmer who ever wrote a program in Tcl, Perl, C++, Visual Basic, or even
C could have chosen Lisp, Scheme, or Smalltalk.  But they didn't.  If you
want to know the truth, I think you need to stop making superficial excuses
and ask deeper semantic questions.  There really is something better about
each of these "ugly languages" that gives them an advantage over the "good"
languages;  I'll leave it up to you to figure out what it is.

or C; there is not a single reason on earth why anyone should use any of
these languages for any programming task.  Scheme truly is the perfect
language that solves every problem and combines the virtues of every
other language.  For years we've been plotting to trick programmers into
using bad languages.  Yes, I mean "we".  Many many people have participated
in this sinister plot, including Larry Wall, Dennis Ritchie, Bill Gates,

     Nice fantasy.

     You know what mine is?  To be bent over
a barrel and fucked by Bill with him twirling
his tongue in my ear as I look over my shoulder
and tell him how much I need him and how I don't
know why I ever held out so long all these years.

Dear Abby -

I am a Vietnam-era deserter from the U. S. Army, and I have a second
cousin who works for Microsoft.  My mother peddles Nazi hate literature
to Girl Scouts and my father (a former dentist) is in jail for 30 years
for raping most of his patients while they were under anesthesia. The
sole supports of our large family, including myself and my $500-a-week
heroin habit, are my uncle (master pick-pocket Benny "The Fingers") and
my aunt and kid sisters, who are well-known street walkers.

My problem is this:  I have just gotten engaged to the most beautiful,
sweetest girl in the world. She is just sweet sixteen, and we are going
to marry as soon as she can escape from reform school. To support
ourselves, we are going to move to Mexico and start a fake Aztec
souvenir factory staffed by child labor.  We look forward to bringing
our kids into the family business.  But -- I am worried that my family
will not make a good impression on hers, once she has a chance to meet
them.

In your opinion, Abby:  Should I -- or shouldn't I -- let her know about
my second cousin who works for Microsoft?

Regards,

	Troubled?

Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder these many, many

gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty years to blow him
up with a book. But the gunpowder destroys itself along with its victim,
while a book can keep on exploding for centuries.

ik was in griekenland en lag op het strand met mijn 3 vriendinnen
(klinkt toch wel weer roze ja) en opeens zie ik daar een kerel aankomen
met een ongelooflijk grote lul. het was een enorme bult in zijn zwarte
boxer, je kon er echt niet omheen, dus ik zeg tegen mijn vriendin clau,
jeetje, moet je daar eens kijken, die kerel heeft wel een enorm grote
lul. 

maar toen hij dichterbij kwam bleek het zijn heuptasje te zijn! 

later die dag kwamen we hem tegen op een terrasje en toen zei hij tegen
mij..."ik heb je vandaag gezien op het strand; en er gebeurde wat". "ja"
zeg ik, wij dachten dat je nogal fors geschapen was maar het bleek je
heuptasje te zijn". daar kon hij niet om lachen. we hebben hem nog
geadviseerd om een andere kleur heuptas aan te schaffen ipv zwart om
verwarring in de toekomst te voorkomen maar ook daar kon hij niet om
lachen.

wij wel.

Pajero in Castillian Spanish is somebody masturbating himself.  The goof

The name of the model was changed in Spain to 'Montero'.

The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la.
Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of
signs had been printed that the phrase means "bite the wax tadpole" or
"female horse stuffed with wax" depending on the dialect.  Coke then
researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic
equivalent, "ko-kou-ko-le," which can be loosely translated as "happiness

STERRE'S SCHILDPOEDPASSENSAP


Ingredienten: 

- een schildpoedpas
- 2 meunieres
- bosje rapen
- zeezout

Was de pas.  Schil de poed (houdt de haren apart)  Vet de rapen in en
marineer de meunieres.  Doe de poed bij de rapen (stelen afhalen!)
Intrekken.  Wring de pas goed uit (vocht opvangen) en stoffeer deze
geheel met de meunieres.  Intrekken.  Pureer de poed met rapen.
Gestoffeerde pas in dobbelsteentjes snijden en door de puree roeren.
Pasvocht lepelsgewijs erdoorheen roeren tot gewenste dikte bereikt is.
Zeezout.

Met rietje.  Kamertemperatuur (geen ijs!)

Serveertip: kransjes van gevlochten poedenhaar.

En probeer de volgende keer ook eens een dwangschildpoedpas, ze zijn er
in verschillende smaken.  Voor wie er van houdt is de roodwang aan te
bevelen, maar pas op!  Het roo heeft een karakteristiek bittertje, waar
je van moet houden.

When, in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one person to dissolve the brown
sticky glop which has connected a disused coffee
cup to a desk, and to assume among the powers of the
caffeine, the desperate and inexorable attraction
to which the laws of addiction and of addiction's
God entitle them, a decent respect to the tastebuds
of mankind requires that they should declare the
drug which impels them to the dependency.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
not all beans are roasted equally, that they are
endowed by their roaster with certain unalienable
darknesses, that among these roasts are French,
Italian, and the pursuit of the perfect espresso.
That to secure these roasts, cafes are instituted
among men, deriving their just income from the
pennies of the addicted.

The Malenky Zeta function (not to be confused with the Reimann Zeta
function) is not defined.  This is because I just made it up on the spot.
Therefore the system defaults to zeta(x) = 0 as for all undefined functions.
Thus, any real value can be determined to be a zero of the zeta function.
There are infinitely many real values not equal to 1/2.  QED.

Emacs is for people who desperately want to get drunk, but feel guilty

If you have a bulletproof keyboard and a Class 3 license, Emacs is
useful for practicing intricate bullet placement in full-auto mode:
"Look, Mildred, I managed to hit the sequence to save the file and
exit the editor, while simultaneously sending a Morse code message
to Major Tom's capsule!"   "Sure, Ed, but ya used a whole 50-round

If parts of the System (drivers and apps) are not protected from each
other, and can send messages to Apps (or each other) directly, or they
can access each others memory directly, then this system is considered a
monolithic system (all one combined unit).

    NOTE: WinNT is not a MicroKernel, Rhapsody and Mac OS 9 both use the
          Mach MicroKernel.

		-- David K. Every, "Memory Protection -- What Is It?"
%
So what is protected memory?  Who has protected Memory(1)?
Theoretically, either a System that uses ANY one of these techniques
-- or -- a System that uses ALL of them.  MacOS uses many (most) of
these techniques (more are added all the time) -- but some say that the
Mac doesn't have memory protection.  Some say that Win95 has memory
protection, yet Win95 uses a few of these techniques (some of the time)
-- and arguably less than the Mac has.  I think they need to learn to
measure using the same yardstick!  WinNT uses a few more techniques, and
Unix/Mach (Rhapsody and MacOS 9) use even more.  But it still comes down
to how WELL each System uses the techniques it has.  So it is an issue
of degrees and not absolutes.

    (1) Common usage is that if you have the first element of memory
        protection (System Wide Protection) than you have protected
        memory.  But a System that does System-Wide Protection only, and
        fails in most of the rest of the areas, then is not likely to be
        stable.  Much of the issue falls onto the quality of the apps and
        how bad your System NEEDS protection.

Recently, I printed out every page of Iomega's technical support web
pages for the Mac and the PC and then taped each group together.  When
it was my turn to speak, I walked to one end of the large banquet hall
we meet in and I set the PC stack down. I grabbed the end, held it over
my head, and started walking across the room as the pages just kept
coming off the stack.  As I walked, I said, "One of the simplest things
you can do to a computer is to hook up a Zip drive.  If you try that on
a PC, here's all the possible problems you might have."

When I reached the other side, there was still a stack of papers at
the other end so I started pulling the paper in big waves. Eventually
there was a pile at my feet and trail of paper all the way across the
room. The other members were stunned.  Then I said, "If you try it on
the Mac, here are the problems you might have." I held up the Mac stack
and let it unravel.  It was three pages long! And the last two pages
were about using a DOS card inside your Mac, so I ripped them off,
leaving the one Mac page in my hand.

The integer four can be represented as the sum of two distinct primes,
3 and 1.  Since we have previously proven that any integer is equal to
four, and since the set of all even integers greater than four is a
subset of the set of all integers, we can assert that any even integer
greater than four can be represented as the sum of two distinct primes.

Het vervangen van promovendi-medewerkers door promovendi-bursalen leidt
ertoe dat het aanbod van promovendi zal versmallen: degenen wier hart
niet alleen bij de wetenschap maar ook eingiszins bij de eigen
portemonnaie ligt, zullen afhaken. Deze versmalling hoeft geen
verschraling te zijn; juist idealisten moeten in staat worden geacht
proefschriften van hoog wetenschappelijk gehalte te schrijven.

Wel is het verwonderlijk dat de hedendaagse Universiteit, die de mond
zo vol heeft van derde-geldstroomfinanciering, maatschappelijk relevant
onderzoek, en samenwerking met het bedrijfsleven, de toekomst tegemoet
denkt te kunnen gaan met een kader van commercieel ongeinteresseerde
idealisten.

My theory about interpreting dreams is that the symbolism game is
bullshit.  Cigars are just cigars.  Flying is just flying.  Having sex
