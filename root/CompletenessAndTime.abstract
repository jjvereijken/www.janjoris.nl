We prove soundness and completeness for some ACP-style concrete,
relative-time, discrete-time process algebras. We treat non-delayable
actions, delayable actions, and immediate deadlock. Basic process
algebras are examined extensively, and also some concurrent process
algebras are considered. We conclude with ACPdrt, which combines all
described features in one theory.
