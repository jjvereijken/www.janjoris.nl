<UL>
<LI>Posing as a rough sailor. Don't believe it, I already get seasick when
    taking a shower.
<LI>Working out, that is, carrying a serious amount of beer.
<LI>I still can't believe I really ate this trash. I was sick for three days,
    to the extent that I was in doubt which end of my body I should
    aim at the toilet first...

<H2>She!</H2>

These pictures are of <A HREF="https://www.stibbe.xyz/">Tieleke
Stibbe</A>, my wife. Ain't she cute?

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="https://www.stibbe.xyz/">Tieleke</A> wearing 
    the <EM>Love at first sight</EM> shirt I bought her.
    It really was; and I don't even believe in such crap.
<LI><A HREF="https://www.stibbe.xyz/">Tieleke</A> 
    drinking a <EM>Valkenburgs Wit</EM> beer at <EM>Babbels</EM>, 
    our favorite summer hangout in Leiden, The Netherlands. The shirt
    she's wearing was a gift from a friend, neither she nor I has ever
    studied at Brown.
</UL>

<H2>They.</H2>

This picture is of some former colleagues.

<UL>
<LI>From left to right: Jan van Hartevelt, Erik Kruyt, and Gerard Borsboom.
    They're the ones <EM>really</EM> in charge of the ship.
    All wearing sunglasses because they don't want to be recognized
    (they don't have their own home page yet, and are ashamed of it).
</UL>

<H2>By the way...</H2>

These pictures were taken in the summer of 1992 near Leiden, The
Netherlands and Wiltz, Luxemburg.
